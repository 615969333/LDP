<para>Fultus Corporation helps writers and companies to publish, promote,
market, and sell books and eBooks. Fultus combines traditional self-publishing
practices with modern technology to produce paperback and hardcover
print-on-demand (POD) books and electronic books (eBooks).
Fultus publishes works (fiction, non-fiction, science fiction, mystery,
...) by both published and unpublished authors. We enable you to
self-publish easily and cost-effectively, creating your book as
a print-ready paperback or hardcover POD book or as an electronic
book (eBook) in multiple eBook's formats. You retain all rights
to your work. We provide distribution to bookstores worldwide. And all
at a fraction of the cost of traditional publishing.
We also offer corporate publishing solutions that enable businesses to
produce and deliver manuals and documentation more efficiently and
economically. Our use of electronic delivery and print-on-demand technologies
reduces printed inventory and saves time.</para>
