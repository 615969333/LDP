NAT (Network Address Translation)
</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>
NAT is a way of providing access to the Internet through a single machine that translates the IP addresses. The NAT itself has one or more IP addresses, but all the machines behind the NAT have &quot;private&quot; Internet addresses. Contrast: A NAT provides some firewalling capabilities because isolates the end-nodes while still providing access to the Internet. The isolation is better than packet-filter firewalls, but not as good as proxies. From Hacking-Lexicon

NFS
</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>
NFS is the UNIX equivalent of SMB. It is a way through which different machines can import and export local files between each other. Like SMB though, NFS sends information including user passwords unencrypted, so it&apos;s best to limit its usage to within your local network. The Network File System (NFS) was developed to allow machines to mount a disk partition on a remote machine as if it were on a local hard drive. This allows for fast, seamless sharing of files across a network. It also gives the potential for unwanted people to access your hard drive over the network (and thereby possibly read your email and delete all your files as well as break into your system) if you set it up incorrectly. So please read the Security section of this document carefully if you intend to implement an NFS setup. There are other systems that provide similar functionality to NFS. Samba (http://www.samba.org) provides file services to Windows clients. The Andrew File System from IBM (http://www.transarc.com/Product/EFS/AFS/index.html), recently open-sourced, provides a file sharing mechanism with some additional security and performance features. The Coda File System (http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/) is still in development as of this writing but is designed to work well with disconnected clients. Many of the features of the Andrew and Coda file systems are slated for inclusion in the next version of NFS (Version 4) (http://www.nfsv4.org). The advantage of NFS today is that it is mature, standard, well understood, and supported robustly across a variety of platforms. From NFS-HOWTO

NetBIOS
</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>
In Windows, NetBIOS is a way for writing network-aware applications, much like sockets is for UNIX. Misunderstanding: Like sockets, many different protocols can be used to transport applications written to the NetBIOS API. When you say &quot;NetBIOS&quot;, some people will understand you to mean the TCP/IP transport. Other people will think of &quot;NetBEUI&quot;, which is the transport over raw Ethernet without any intervening routable network protocol. Use the term &quot;NBT&quot; (NetBIOS-over-TCP) or &quot;NetBEUI&quot; to avoid confusion. Contrast: Microsoft&apos;s &quot;File and Print Sharing&quot; uses the SMB protocol over NetBIOS. Microsoft supports the NetBIOS interface over TCP/IP, NetBEUI, and Novell&apos;s IPX/SPX. Home users who share files among their own machines mistakenly enable File and Print Sharing using the TCP/IP transport, allowing hackers anywhere on the Internet access to their machine. Instead, they should configure it over the NetBEUI transport so that nobody outside their network can access their files (note: this still might open up their networks to people on the same cable-modem VLAN). History: Originally developed by SyTek for IBM. It was implemented in the ROM of IBM&apos;ss broadband Ethernet (3-mbps, over cable TV coax rather than normal Ethernet coax, separate send/receive channels). More: If you maintain a firewall, you will see regular NetBIOS requests in your logs. Read the document http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/firewall-seen.html#netbios for more info.

Newsgroups
</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>
A newsgroup is a notice board that everyone in the world can see. There are tens of thousands of newsgroups and each group is unique in the world. The client software you use to read a newsgroup is called a news reader (or news client). rtin is a popular text mode reader, while netscape is graphical. pan is an excellent graphical news reader that I use. Newsgroups are named like Internet hosts. One you might be interested in is comp.os.linux.announce. The comp is the broadest subject description for computers; os stands for operating systems; and so on. Many other linux newsgroups are devoted to various LINUX issues. Newsgroups servers are big hungry beasts. They form a tree-like structure on the Internet. When you send mail to a newsgroup it takes about a day or so for the mail you sent to propagate to every other server in the world. Likewise, you can see a list of all the messages posted to each newsgroup by anyone anywhere. What&apos;s the difference between a newsgroup and a mailing list? The advantage of a newsgroup is that you don&apos;t have to download the messages you are not interested in. If you are on a mailing list, you get all the mail sent to the list. With a newsgroup you can look at the message list and retrieve only the messages you are interested in.  Why not just put the mailing list on a web page? If you did, then everyone in the world would have to go over international links to get to the web page. It would load the server in proportion to the number of subscribers. This is exactly what SlashDot is. However, your newsgroup server is local, so you retrieve mail over a faster link and save Internet traffic. From Rute-Users-Guide

The default file format a program uses to store data on disk. The format is often a proprietary file format. Many popular programs today can retrieve and save data in several formats. See ASCII. Computer scientists are working to improve computers so that they can respond to natural language. Human languages are so complex that no single model of a natural language grammar system has gashed widespread acceptance among linguists. The complexity OF human languages, coupled with the lack of under standing about what information is needed to decode human sentences, makes it difficult to devise programs that recognize speech. Progress in solving these problems has been slow. From QUECID

ICMP support will be finished shortly.  * Copy, move and delete packets in the trace file.  * Fragment and reassemble IP packets.  * Netdude constantly communicates with a tcpdump process to update    the familiar tcpdump output that corresponds to the trace. This    also means that any changes made to your local version of tcpdump    are reflected in Netdude.  * Plugin architecture: people can easily add plugins for specific    tasks. The code comes with a plugin for checksum correction in IP,    TCP and UDP, and a dummy plugin.  * Through the plugin mechanism, Netdude provides a good facility for    writing tcpdump trace file filters.

the Network Object agent daemon The Network Objects package provides a simple but powerful facility for remote method invocation in the context of Modula-3.  Under Network Objects, all subtypes of the object type NetObj.T are treated specially in that they can be passed to remote address spaces by reference.  This remote reference appears at the destination as a surrogate object which is a subtype of the original object type.  If the original type has methods, these methods can be remotely invoked through the surrogate. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

A network performance tool using LAM MPI NetPIPE is a protocol independent performance tool that encapsulates the best of ttcp and netperf and visually represents the network performance under a variety of conditions. By taking the end-to-end application view of a network, NetPIPE clearly shows the overhead associated with different protocol layers. NetPIPE answers such questions as: how soon will a given data block of size k arrive at its destination? Which network and protocol will transmit size k blocks the fastest? What is a given network&apos;s effective maximum throughput and saturation level?  Does there exist a block size k for which the throughput is maximized? How much communication overhead is due to the network communication protocol layer(s)? How quickly will a small (&lt; 1 kbyte) control message arrive, and which network and protocol are best for this purpose? This package measures network performance using the MPI protocol, a Message Passing Interface frequently used in parallel processing, and which uses in turn TCP as its underlying transport.

nmap
</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>
The Network Mapper nmap is a utility for port scanning large networks, although it works fine for single hosts.  The guiding philosophy for the creation of nmap was TMTOWTDI (There&apos;s More Than One Way To Do It).  This is the Perl slogan, but it is equally applicable to scanners.  Sometimes you need speed, other times you may need stealth.  In some cases, bypassing firewalls may be required. Not to mention the fact that you may want to scan different protocols (UDP, TCP, ICMP, etc.).  You just can&apos;t do all this with one scanning mode.  And you don&apos;t want to have 10 different scanners around, all with different interfaces.  Thus I incorporated virtually every scanning technique I know into nmap.  Specifically, nmap supports:        Vanilla TCP connect() scanning,        TCP SYN (half open) scanning,        TCP FIN (stealth) scanning,        TCP ftp proxy (bounce attack) scanning        SYN/FIN scanning using IP fragments (bypasses packet filters),        UDP recvfrom() scanning,        UDP raw ICMP port unreachable scanning,        ICMP scanning (ping-sweep), and        Reverse-ident scanning. nmap also supports a number of performance and reliability features such as dynamic delay time calculations, packet timeout and retransmission, parallel port scanning, detection of down hosts via parallel pings, and flexible target and port specification.

Unlike most mail user agents, nmh is not a single program, rather it is a set of programs that are run from the shell.  This allows the user to utilize the full power of the Unix shell in coordination with nmh.  Various front-ends are available, such as mh-e (an emacs mode), xmh, and exmh (X11 clients). nmh was originally based on MH version 6.8.3, and is intended to be a (mostly) compatible drop-in replacement for MH.

Nn allows you to quickly select articles of interest and skip the rest.  It also supports efficient article killing and selection of articles by author and subject. This version of nn reads news from a news server via NNTP (the Network News Transfer Protocol), and can make use of your NNTP server&apos;s NOV database, if configured.  You must have a news server available - large sites usually provide a site-wide server.  (For those familiar with &apos;nn&apos;, this is a client-only version.) From Debian 3.0r0 APT

<para>
a Relational Database Management System for Unix. NoSQL is a fast, portable, relational database management system without arbitrary limits, (other than memory and processor speed) that runs under, and interacts with, the UNIX Operating System. It uses the Operator/Stream DBMS paradigm described in &quot;Unix Review&quot;, March, 1991, page 24, entitled &quot;A 4GL Language&quot;.  There are a number of &quot;operators&quot; that each perform a unique function on the data.  The &quot;stream&quot; is supplied by the UNIX Input/Output redirection mechanism.  Therefore each operator processes some data and then passes it along to the next operator via the UNIX pipe function.  This is very efficient as UNIX pipes are implemented in memory.  NoSQL is compliant with the &quot;Relational Model&quot;.  *NOTE*: This is a new, re-designed, more performant upstream release which          is no longer command-line compatible with NoSQL V2.          The commands are now in /usr/lib/nosql3 in order to not clutter up          /usr/bin. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

shared text editor designed for use on the Mbone. NTE is a shared text editor designed for use on the Mbone. It is not a word processor (it is not clear that word processing is a useful task to share) and it is not a whiteboard - if you want a whiteboard, wb from LBL is a much better whiteboard. Using NTE can be very interactive - unless you lock a block of text, anyone else in your session can edit that text or delete it. This is intentional. Many people can (if they wish) edit the same document simultaneously. Many people can even edit the same block of text simultaneously, but if more than one person tries to edit the same line at one time, a conflict will occur, which results in only one of the changes being preserved.

Tools for doing neat things in NTFS partitions from Linux. The Linux-NTFS project (http://linux-ntfs.sf.net/) aims to bring full support for the NTFS filesystem to the Linux operating system. This is a set of tools targeted for people interested in working with the NTFS support in the Linux kernel and using it. The following utilities are included: ntfsfix - Attempt to fix an NTFS partition that has been damaged by the Linux NTFS driver. You should run it every time after you have used the Linux NTFS driver to write to an NTFS partition to prevent massive data corruption from happening when Windows mounts the partition. mkntfs - Format a partition with the NTFS filesystem.

ntp

<glossdef>
<para>
Daemon and utilities for full NTP v4 timekeeping participation. The Network Time Protocol allows for the synchronization of clocks on networked computers.  The ntpd daemon implements NTP, allowing Unix systems to participate in this synchronization. To minimize resource consumption in the general case, this package no longer includes the actual daemon.  You will need either ntp-simple or ntp-refclock, depending on whether you want the drivers for radio clocks included in the refclock version of the daemon. NTP was designed with attention to details which might introduce systematic bias into the computations, and the protocol is capable of synchronizing with even the most precise external time sources. For more information on how NTP works, and how to configure a campus of ntpd daemons, load the optional Debian package &apos;ntp-doc&apos;. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer&apos;stime with another reference time source. The ntp package contains utilities and daemons that will synchronize your computer&apos;s time to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) via the NTP protocol and NTP servers. The ntp package includes ntpdate (a program for retrieving the date and time from remote machines via a network) and ntpd (a daemon which continuously adjusts system time). Install the ntp package if you need tools for keeping your system&apos;s time synchronized via the NTP protocol. From Redhat 8.0 RPM

The ntpdate client for setting system time from NTP servers. The ntpdate client allows a system&apos;s clock to be set to match the time obtained by communicating with one or more servers running the NTP protocol. The use of ntpdate is optional if you&apos;re running the ntp package, it can help a system obtain lock if it starts with a time that&apos;s pretty close by using ntpdate before starting the daemon. The ntpdate client by itself is useful for occasionally setting the time on machines that are not on the net full-time, such as laptops. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

Network UPS Tools This daemon can monitor a large assortment of UPS hardware and can provide notification to other computers via it&apos;s client/server architecture. One computer is configured to act as a master and the others are configured as slaves. This package provides the best features of the other Debian UPS packages but is not based on any of them. Specifically, it is better because: 1) it has the  ability to talk to a wide variety of hardware in both dumb and smart modes, similar to genpower; and 2) it has network capability in that it can act as a UPS server (master) for other UPS client boxes (slaves), similar to apcd. Finally, the companion package, nut-cgi, provides cgi scripts that can display the status of UPS on a web page. (potato debs can be found at http://people.debian.org/~lfilipoz) From Debian 3.0r0 APT
