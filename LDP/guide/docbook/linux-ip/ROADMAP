Minor items and required experiments:

 - complete the cookbook chapters on advanced routing
 - binding to non-local IPs
   - pass traffic on a router while bound to a non-local; should
     get caught--other traffic should pass through
   - pass traffic on a bridge while bound to a non-local; should
     get caught--other traffic should pass through
 - ARP tests
   - use kernel proxy_arp with medium_id (sysctl)
 - test ip route add prohibit, ip route add blackhole, ip route add
   unreachable, and, ip route add throw (throw?)
 - learn how to read ip -s route show cache; what is cwnd, rtt, rttvar
   and advmss, and how to use the info
 - use ip route add default nexthop
 - test NAT from a host in one IP address range to a host in another
   address range which happens to share the same media segment
   - suppress redirects?
 - test single and multiple dummy interfaces
 - link layer broadcast; use ip link set broadcast to change the ethernet
   broadcast address on several hosts and see what happens

Major work:

 - edit the tools appendices for accuracy, grammar, spelling
 - add bridging 802.11; gatewaying 802.11
 - add a bibliography for books like Stevens, etc.
 - consider introduction to traffic control with pointer to LARTC
