    <title>/home</title>

      <para>Linux is a multi-user environment so each user is also 
      assigned a specific directory that is accessible only to them 
      and the system administrator. These are the user home directories, 
      which can be found under '/home/$USER' (~/). It is your playground:
      everything is at your command, you can write files, delete them, 
      install programs, etc.... Your home directory contains your 
      personal configuration files, the so-called dot files (their name 
      is preceded by a dot). Personal configuration files are usually 'hidden', 
      if you want to see them, you either have to turn on the appropriate 
      option in your file manager or run ls with the -a switch. If there is 
      a conflict between personal and system wide configuration files, the 
      settings in the personal file will prevail. </para>

      <para>Dotfiles most likely to be altered by the end user are probably 
      your .xsession and .bashrc files. The configuration files for X and 
      Bash respectively. They allow you to be able to change the window 
      manager to be startup upon login and also aliases, user-specified 
      commands and environment variables respectively. Almost always when a
      user is created their dotfiles will be taken from the /etc/skel directory 
      where system administrators place a sample file that user's can modify to 
      their hearts content.</para>

      <para>/home can get quite large and can be used for storing downloads, 
      compiling, installing and running programs, your mail, your collection 
      of image or sound files etc.</para>
