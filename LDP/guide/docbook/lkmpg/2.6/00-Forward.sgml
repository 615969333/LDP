<sect1><title>Authorship</title>

	<para>The Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide was originally written for the 2.2 kernels by Ori Pomerantz.  Eventually, Ori
	no longer had time to maintain the document.  After all, the Linux kernel is a fast moving target.  Peter Jay Salzman took
	over maintenance and updated it for the 2.4 kernels.  Eventually, Peter no longer had time to follow developments with the 2.6
	kernel, so Michael Burian became a co-maintainer to update the document for the 2.6 kernels.</para>





<sect1><title>Versioning and Notes</title>

	<para>The Linux kernel is a moving target.  There has always been a question whether the LKMPG should remove deprecated
	information or keep it around for historical sake.  Michael Burian and I decided to create a new branch of the LKMPG for each
	new stable kernel version.  So version LKMPG 2.4.x will address Linux kernel 2.4 and LKMPG 2.6.x will address Linux kernel
	2.6.  No attempt will be made to archive historical information; a person wishing this information should read the
	appropriately versioned LKMPG.</para>

	<para>The source code and discussions should apply to most architectures, but I can't promise anything.  One exception is
	<xref linkend="interrupthandlers">, Interrupt Handlers, which should not work on any architecture except for x86.</para>

<sect1><title>Acknowledgements</title>

	<para>Ori Pomerantz would like to thank Yoav Weiss for many helpful ideas, discussions, and corrections.  He would also like
	to thank Frodo Looijaard from the Netherlands, Stephen Judd from New Zealand, Magnus Ahltorp from Sweeden and Emmanuel
	Papirakis from Quebec, Canada.</para>

	<para>Peter would also like to thank Ori for letting him take over the LKMPG.  He would also like to thank Jeff Newmiller,
	Rhonda Frances Bailey (who is now Rhonda Frances Salzman) and Mark Kim for teaching him with patience and friendship
	regardless how busy they were.  He would also like to thank David Porter who had the unenviable job of helping convert the
	original LaTeX source into docbook.  It was a long and boring job, but had to be done.</para>

	<para> Thanks also goes to the fine people at <ulink url="www.kernelnewbies.org">www.kernelnewbies.org</ulink>.  In
	particular, Mark McLoughlin and John Levon who I'm sure have much better things to do than to hang out on kernelnewbies.org
	and teach the newbies.  If this guide teaches you anything, they are partially to blame.</para>

	<para>Both Ori and I would like to thank Richard M. Stallman and Linus Torvalds for giving us the opportunity to not only run
	a high-quality operating system, but to take a close peek at how it works.</para>

	<para>The following people have contributed corrections or good suggestions: Ignacio Martin, David Porter, Daniele Paolo
	Scarpazza and Dimo Velev</para>
