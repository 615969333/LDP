<sect1><title>Authorship</title>

	<para>The Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide was originally written for the 2.2 kernels by Ori Pomerantz.  Eventually, Ori
	no longer had time to maintain the document.  After all, the Linux kernel is a fast moving target.  Peter Jay Salzman took
	over maintenance and updated it for the 2.4 kernels.  Eventually, Peter no longer had time to follow developments with the 2.6
	kernel, so Michael Burian became a co-maintainer to update the document for the 2.6 kernels.</para>

<sect1><title>Versioning and Notes</title>

	<para>The Linux kernel is a moving target.  There has always been a question whether the LKMPG should remove deprecated
	information or keep it around for historical sake.  Michael Burian and I decided to create a new branch of the LKMPG for each
	new stable kernel version.  So version LKMPG 2.4.x will address Linux kernel 2.4 and LKMPG 2.6.x will address Linux kernel
	2.6.  No attempt will be made to archive historical information; a person wishing this information should read the
	appropriately versioned LKMPG.</para>

	<para>The source code and discussions should apply to most architectures, but I can't promise anything.  One exception is
	<xref linkend="interrupthandlers">, Interrupt Handlers, which should not work on any architecture except for x86.</para>

<sect1><title>Note From the Chinese Translator</title>

	<para>I am Jerry Tian, the translator of the simplified Chinese edition of this guide, and now a university student in
	Beijing.  I became a GNU/Linux enthusiast when I first encountered it as a senior high school; I like the spirit of
	freedom in open source software.</para>

	<para>This guide is the most updated document in Linux kernel module programming.  I have also translated the former 2.4
	branch of LKMPG into simplified Chinese, but based on HTML files, so it's inconvenient to convert it to other formats.  Thanks
	to Peter's advice and encouragement, the translation of 2.6 branch is based on DOCBOOK files, and it's very easy to convert it
	to other formats like HTML, PDF, etc.  Most of its content is from the translation of 2.4 branch, but some translation
	mistakes in 2.4 branch are corrected.  Since I hardly have enough time to go through the 2.4 branch of translation again and
	correct the mistakes in the HTML files, I suggest if you need to read the simplified translation of 2.4 branch of LKMPG, do
	refer to the translation of 2.6 branch.  Please contact me if you have any ideas on how to improve the simplified Chinese
	translation of LKMPG or want to help me maintain it.</para>

	<para>My email address is jerrytianbupt@163.com.  Learning and sharing the learning is the motive of my translation.  I hope
	you enjoy it!  </para>
