<sect1><title>Acknowledgements</title>

	<para>Ori Pomerantz would like to thank Yoav Weiss for many helpful ideas
	and discussions, as well as finding mistakes within this document before
	its publication.  Ori would also like to thank Frodo Looijaard from the
	Netherlands, Stephen Judd from New Zealand, Magnus Ahltorp from Sweeden and
	Emmanuel Papirakis from Quebec, Canada.</para>

	<para>I'd like to thank Ori Pomerantz for authoring this guide in the first
	place and then letting me maintain it.  It was a tremendous effort on his
	part.  I hope he likes what I've done with this document.</para>

	<para> I would also like to thank Jeff Newmiller and Rhonda Bailey for
	teaching me.  They've been patient with me and lent me their experience,
	regardless of how busy they were.  David Porter had the unenviable job of
	helping convert the original LaTeX source into docbook.  It was a long,
	boring and dirty job.  But someone had to do it.  Thanks, David.</para>

	<para> Thanks also goes to the fine people at <ulink
	url="www.kernelnewbies.org">www.kernelnewbies.org</ulink>.  In particular,
	Mark McLoughlin and John Levon who I'm sure have much better things to do
	than to hang out on kernelnewbies.org and teach the newbies.  If this guide
	teaches you anything, they are partially to blame.</para>

	<para>Both Ori and I would like to thank Richard M. Stallman and Linus
	Torvalds for giving us the opportunity to not only run a high-quality
	operating system, but to take a close peek at how it works.  I've never met
	Linus, and probably never will, but he has made a profound difference in my
	life.</para>

	<para>The following people have written to me with corrections or good
	suggestions: Ignacio Martin and David Porter</para>

<sect1><title>Nota Bene</title>

	<para>Ori's original document was good about supporting earlier versions of
	Linux, going all the way back to the 2.0 days.  I had originally intended
	to keep with the program, but after thinking about it, opted out.  My main
	reason to keep with the compatibility was for Linux distributions like
	LEAF, which tended to use older kernels.  However, even LEAF uses 2.2 and
	2.4 kernels these days.<para>

	<para>Both Ori and I use the x86 platform.  For the most part, the source
	code and discussions should apply to other architectures, but I can't
	promise anything.  One exception is chapter (fixme), on interrupt handlers,
	which should not work on any architecture except for x86.</para>
