	<para>Very often, we have <quote>housekeeping</quote> tasks which have to be done at a certain time, or every so
	often. If the task is to be done by a process, we do it by putting it in the <filename>crontab</filename> file.
	If the task is to be done by a kernel module, we have two possibilities.  The first is to put a process in the
	<filename>crontab</filename> file which will wake up the module by a system call when necessary, for example by
	opening a file. This is terribly inefficient, however -- we run a new process off of <filename>crontab</filename>,
	read a new executable to memory, and all this just to wake up a kernel module which is in memory anyway.</para>

	<indexterm><primary>tq_struct</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>queue_task</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>tq_timer</primary></indexterm>

	<para>Instead of doing that, we can create a function that will be called once for every timer interrupt.  The way
	we do this is we create a task, held in a <structname>tq_struct</structname> structure, which will hold a pointer
	to the function.  Then, we use <function>queue_task</function> to put that task on a task list called
	<structname>tq_timer</structname>, which is the list of tasks to be executed on the next timer interrupt.  Because
	we want the function to keep on being executed, we need to put it back on <structname>tq_timer</structname>
	whenever it is called, for the next timer interrupt.</para>

	<indexterm><primary>rmmod</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>reference count</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>module_cleanup</primary></indexterm>

	<para>There's one more point we need to remember here.  When a module is removed by <command>rmmod</command>,
	first its reference count is checked.  If it is zero, <function>module_cleanup</function> is called.  Then, the
	module is removed from memory with all its functions.  Nobody checks to see if the timer's task list happens to
	contain a pointer to one of those functions, which will no longer be available.  Ages later (from the computer's
	perspective, from a human perspective it's nothing, less than a hundredth of a second), the kernel has a timer
	interrupt and tries to call the function on the task list.  Unfortunately, the function is no longer there.  In
	most cases, the memory page where it sat is unused, and you get an ugly error message.  But if some other code is
	now sitting at the same memory location, things could get <emphasis>very</emphasis> ugly.  Unfortunately, we don't
	have an easy way to unregister a task from a task list.</para>

	<indexterm><primary>sleep_on</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>module_sleep_on</primary></indexterm>

	<para>Since <function>cleanup_module</function> can't return with an error code (it's a void function), the
	solution is to not let it return at all.  Instead, it calls <function>sleep_on</function> or
	<function>module_sleep_on</function><footnote><para>They're really the same.</para></footnote> to put the
	<command>rmmod</command> process to sleep.  Before that, it informs the function called on the timer interrupt to
	stop attaching itself by setting a global variable.  Then, on the next timer interrupt, the
	<command>rmmod</command> process will be woken up, when our function is no longer in the queue and it's safe to
	remove the module.</para>
