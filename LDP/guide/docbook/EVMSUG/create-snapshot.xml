<para>This chapter discusses snapshotting and tells how to create 
a snapshot.</para>


<sect1 id="whatissnapshotting"><title>What is a snapshot?</title>

<para>A snapshot represents a frozen image of a volume.  
The source of a snapshot is
called an &quot;original.&quot;  
When a snapshot is created, it looks exactly like the original
at that point in time.  
As changes are made to the original, the snapshot remains the
same and looks exactly like the original at the time the snapshot was 
created.
</para>

<para>The snapshot feature is very useful for performing data backups.  
In order to perform a consistent backup, the volume that is being backed up 
should not change while the
backup is running.  
This often means the volume must be taken offline during the
backup, which can be a significant inconvenience to users.  
With snapshots, the volume can be kept online.  
A snapshot of the volume is created and the backup is taken
from the snapshot, while the original remains in active use.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="createactivsnap"><title>Creating and activating snapshot objects</title>

<para>Creating and activating a snapshot is a two-step process.  
The first step is to create the snapshot object.  
The snapshot object specifies where the saved data will
be stored when changes are made to the original.  
The second step is to activate the
object, which is to make an EVMS volume from the object.</para>

<sect2><title>Creating a snapshot</title>
<para>You can create a snapshot object from any unused storage object in EVMS
(disks, segments, regions, or feature objects).  
The size of this consumed object is
the size available to the snapshot object.  The snapshot object can be smaller
or larger than the original volume.  
If the object is smaller, the original volume could fill up
as data is copied from the original to the snapshot, given sufficient 
activity on the original.
In this situation, the snapshot is deactivated and additional 
I/O to the snapshot fails.
</para>

<para>Base the size of the snapshot object on the amount of activity that 
is likely to take place on the original during the lifetime of the snapshot.  
The more changes that occur on the
original and the longer the snapshot is expected to remain active, 
the larger the snapshot should be.  
Clearly, determining this calculation is not simple and requires trial and 
error to determine the correct snapshot object size to use for a 
particular situation.  
The goal is to create a snapshot object large enough to prevent the 
shapshot from being
deactivated if it fills up, yet small enough to not waste disk space.  
If the snapshot
object is the same size as the original volume (actually, a little larger, 
to account for the snapshot mapping tables), the snapshot is 
never deactivated.
</para>

</sect2>


<sect2><title>Activating a snapshot</title>
<para>After you create a snapshot, activate it by making an EVMS volume from the object.
After you create the volume and save the changes, the snapshot is active.  The only
option for activating snapshots is the name to give the EVMS volume.  This name can be
the same as or different than the name of the snapshot object.</para>

<sect1 id="snapshotex"><title>Example: create a snapshot</title>
<para> This section shows how to create a snapshot with EVMS:</para>	

<blockquote><example><title>Create a snapshot of a volume</title>
<para>Create a new snapshot of <filename>/dev/evms/vol</filename> on 
<filename>lvm/Sample Container/Sample Region</filename>, and call 
it &quot;snap.&quot;</para></example></blockquote>

<!-- CLI-->		   
<sect2 id="clisnapshot"><title>Using the CLI</title>

	
	<para>Use the
	<command>create</command> command to create a snapshot through the CLI.  You pass the &quot;Object&quot; keyword to the <command>create</command> command, followed by the plug-in and its options, and finally the objects. </para>

<para>To determine the options for the plug-in you are going to use, issue the following command:</para>
	
<programlisting>query: plugins, plugin=Snapshot, list options</programlisting>
	
<para>Now construct the <command>create</command> command, as follows:</para>

<programlisting>create: object, Snapshot={original=/dev/evms/vol, snapshot=snap}, 
&quot;lvm/Sample Container/Sample Region&quot;</programlisting>	
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>Reinitializing a snapshot</title>
<para>Snapshots can be reinitialized, which causes all of the 
saved data to be erased and
starts the snapshot from the current point in time.  
A reinitialized snapshot has the same
original, chunk size, and writeable flags as the original 
snapshot.</para>

<para>To reinitialize a snapshot, delete the EVMS volume from the 
snapshot without deleting the snapshot object.  
Then create a new EVMS volume from the snapshot object.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>Deleting a snapshot</title>
<para>When a snapshot is no longer needed, you can remove it by deleting the EVMS
volume from the snapshot object, and then deleting the snapshot object.  Because the
snapshot saved the initial state of the original volume (and not the changed state),
the original is always up-to-date and does not need any modifications when a snapshot
is deleted.</para>
<para>No options are available for deleting snapshots.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>Rolling back a snapshot</title>
<para>Situations can arise where a user wants to restore the original volume to
the saved state of the snapshot.  This action is called a rollback.  One such scenario
is if the data on the original is lost or corrupted.  Snapshot rollback acts as a quick
backup and restore mechanism, and allows the user to avoid a more lengthy restore
operation from tapes or other archives.</para>
<para>Another situation where rollback can be particularly useful is when you are
testing new software.  Before you install a new software package, create a writeable
snapshot of the target volume.  You can then install the software to the snapshot
volume, instead of to the original, and then test and verify the new software on the
snapshot.  If the testing is successful, you can then roll back the snapshot to the
original and effectively install the software on the regular system.  If there is a problem
during the testing, you can simply delete the snapshot without harming the original
volume.</para>
<para>Rollback can only be performed when both the snapshot and the original volumes
are unmounted and otherwise not in use.  Rollback can also be performed only when
there is only a single snapshot of an original.  If an original has multiple snapshots,
all but the desired snapshot must be deleted before rollback can take place.</para>
<para>No options are available for rolling back snapshots.</para>
