                   SOME SCRIPTS WILL NOT RUN


Note that the source code for a few of the example shell scripts
(ex57.sh, ex70.sh, ex71.sh, ex71a.sh, ex71b.sh, encryptedpw.sh, pw.sh,
du.sh, rnd.sh, logevents.sh, and rot13.sh) have the "&lt;" and "&gt;"
in place of angle brackets (< and >). This is necessary for the Docbook
SGML conversion. If you plan to run these scripts from the enclosed source
files, then it will, of course, be necessary to restore the angle brackets.

                               &lt;      becomes  <
                               &gt;      becomes  >
                               &lt;&lt;  becomes  <<
                               &gt;&gt;  becomes  >>
