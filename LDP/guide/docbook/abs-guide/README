                        SOME SCRIPTS WILL NOT RUN AS IS


Note that the source code for some of the example shell scripts,

Du.sh
encryptedpw.sh
ex57.sh
ex70.sh
ex71.sh
ex71a.sh
ex71b.sh
logevents.sh
m4.sh
pb.sh
pw.sh
read-r.sh
rnd.sh
rot13.sh
here-function.sh
avoid-subshell.sh (lines 24, 25, and 33)
usb.sh (line 28)
prepend.sh (lines 18 and 28)
array-assign.bash
archiveweblogs.sh (comment in line 4)
directory-info.sh (lines 273 and 353)
is-spammer.sh (comments on lines 4, 35, and 51)
bashrc (comments on lines 596 and 618)
is_spammer.bash (comments on various lines)

have the "&lt;" and "&gt;" in place of angle brackets (< and >), or &amp; in
place of the ampersand (&). This is necessary for the Docbook SGML
conversion. If you plan to run these scripts from the enclosed source
files, then it will, of course, be necessary to restore the angle
brackets or ampersand.

                          &lt;      becomes  <
                          &gt;      becomes  >
                          &lt;&lt;  becomes  <<
                          &gt;&gt;  becomes  >>
