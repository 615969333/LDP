        <para>This book was released by O'Reilly in October 1999, and
        is a great reference to DocBook. I have not found it to be a
        great practical book, and much of the emphasis is on XML, but
        the DocBook tags for version 3.1 are all listed in a handy
        format. You can pick it up at the book vendor of choice. The
        entire book is also available online (in HTML and SGML
        formats) at the above URL. </para>

        <para>Contains links to SGML templates and their resulting HTML output
        to help you see what your document will look like. Many of the tags
        just need to be replaced with information unique to your HOWTO.
        Also contains links to tools and other useful information.

        <para>This spell checking application can work around SGML
        tags, and only spell check the content within the
        tags. Older version of ispell will try to spell
        check the tags, causing errors at every new tag.</para>

<sgmltag class="endtag">figure</sgmltag>
</programlisting>
      <para>This is a better way than using <sgmltag
      class="starttag">graphic</sgmltag> for two reasons.  First, 
      <sgmltag class="starttag">graphic</sgmltag> will be removed in 
      DocBook 5.0 in favor of the <sgmltag
      class="starttag">mediaobject</sgmltag> tag.  So you may as well
      get started with the right way now.  Second, <sgmltag
      class="starttag">mediaobject</sgmltag> allows for different kinds
      of media based on what the output is. In this example, the first
      <sgmltag class="starttag">imageobject</sgmltag> is an encapsulated
      PostScript(eps) file for use with formats derived from TeX such as
      DVI, PS, and PDF. The second <sgmltag
      class="starttag">imageobject</sgmltag> is a JPEG image for visual
      display, mostly for HTML output. The <sgmltag
      class="starttag">textobject</sgmltag> is presented if the output
      doesn't support graphics (TXT).  Think of it as an HTML <sgmltag
      class="starttag">alt</sgmltag> tag.</para>

    <section id="namedfiles">
      <title>Naming separate HTML files</title>
      <para>By default, when separate HTML files are made, the SGML
      processor will assign arbitrary names to the resulting files.
      This can be confusing to readers who may bookmark a page only to
      have it change.  Whatever
      your reasoning, here's how to make separate files named the way
      you want:</para> 
      <para>In your first <sgmltag class="starttag">article</sgmltag>
      tag (which should be the only one) include an id parameter and
      call it index.  This will make your tag look like this:</para> 

      <programlisting format="linespecific">
<sgmltag class="starttag">article id="index"</sgmltag>
</programlisting>

      <para>On the first <sgmltag class="starttag">chapter</sgmltag>
      tag, do not modify it, as it's usually an introduction and you
      want that on the first page.  For each other <sgmltag
      class="starttag">section</sgmltag> tag, include the id parameter
      and name it.  A name should include only alphanumeric characters,
      and it should be short enough to understand what it is.</para>

      <title> Before you distribute </title>
      <para> Before you distribute your code to millions of potential
      readers there are a few things you should do. </para> 
      <para> First, be sure to spell-check your document. Most
      utilities that you would use to write SGML have plug-ins to
      perform a spell check. If not, there's always the aspell
      program. </para> 
      <para> Second, get someone to review your documentation for
      factual correctness.  You can also ask for general
      comments.  The documentation that is
      published by the LDP needs to be as factually correct as
      possible, as there are millions of Linux users that may be
      reading it. If you're part of a larger mailing list talking
      about the subject, ask others from the list to help you
      out. </para> 
      <para> Third, create a web site where you can distribute your
      documentation. This isn't required, but is helpful for people to
      find the original location of your document. </para> 

      <section id="validatecode">
        <title>Validating SGML code </title>
        <para> Using jade, or really the nsgmls command, you can

        <para>Validating XML is a touch harder than validating SGML

        installed, and then set the <envar>SGML_CATALOG_FILES</envar>
        to the location of xml.soc (included with jade) and to
        the location of the DocBook XML catalog file.

      <title> Copyright and Licensing issues </title>
      <para> In order for an LDP document to be accepted by the LDP,
      it must be licensed to conform to the "LICENSE REQUIREMENTS"
      section of the LDP Manifesto located at <ulink
      url="http://www.tldp.org/manifesto.html">http://www.tldp.org/manifesto.html</ulink>.
      As an author, you may retain the copyright and add other
      restrictions (for example, you must approve any translations or
      derivative works). </para>

      <para> We recommend using the <ulink 
      url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">GNU Free Documentation 
      License (GFDL)</ulink> or the <ulink 
      url="http://opencontent.org/openpub/">Open Publication License 
      (OPL)</ulink> <emphasis>without</emphasis> options A and B.  If
      you choose, you can get DocBook markups of both the GNU GPL
      and the GNU FDL from <ulink url="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gdp/licenses.html">
      the GNOME Documentation Project</ulink>.  You can then merely
      include the license in its entirety in your document.  Due
      to its length, you may just want to provide a link
      to the source.</para>
      
      <para>If you choose to use a boilerplate copyright, simply copy it
      into your source code under a section called <quote>Copyright
      and Licenses</quote> or similar. Also include a copyright
      statement of your own (since you still own it). If you are a new
      maintainer of an already-existing HOWTO, you must include the
      previous copyright statements of the previous author(s) and the
      dates they maintained that document. </para> 

      <para>You'll note that the licensing for the LDP Author Guide
      requires notification to the author of any derivative works or
      translations.  I also explicitly place any source code (aside
      from the SGML the Guide was written in) under the GPL. If your
      HOWTO includes bits of source code that you want others to use,
      you may do the same.</para>

    <section id="submission">
      <title> Submission to LDP </title>
      <para> Once your LDP document has been carefully reviewed, you
      can release your document to the LDP. Send an e-mail with the
      SGML source code as an attachment (you may gzip it if you like)
      to <email>submit@en.tldp.org</email>. </para> 

      <para> Be sure to include the name of your HOWTO in the subject
      line, and use the body to outline changes you've made and attach
      your HOWTO. This allows the maintainers to do their jobs faster,
      so you will not have to wait for your HOWTO to be updated on the
      LDP web site. If you don't hear anything in 5 calendar days,
      please follow up with an e-mail to make sure things are still in
      process. </para> 

      <para>If your HOWTO contains extras, such as graphics or a
      special catalog, create a.tar.gz file with all the files in it

      the ldp-submit list.</para>

      <para>If you are using the LDP CVS tree while developing
      your document, the LDP will still need to be notified when your
      document is ready to be published. E-mail should be sent to
      <email>submit@en.tldp.org</email>. Indicate
      the title of your document and the relative path to the
      file(s) in the LDP CVS tree within your message. </para>

    <section id="maintentance">
    <title>Maintaining Your HOWTO</title>

    <para>
      Just because your HOWTO has now been published doesn't mean your
      job is done. HOWTOs need regular maintenance, to make sure they
      are up to date, and to improve them in response to readers' ideas
      and suggestions. A HOWTO is a living, growing body of knowledge,
      not just a publish-and-forget-it static document.
    </para>

    <para>
      You put your email address in the HOWTO, and politely requested
      feedback from your readers, right? Once you are officially published,
      you will begin to receive notes with suggestions. Some will be
      very valuable; others will request personal assistance. You should
      feel free to decline personal assistance if you cannot spare the
      time. Writing a HOWTO for the LDP doesn't commit you to a lifetime
      of free support for anyone on the net. It is polite to refer
      questioners to another resource, if you can. And, if you see a
      pattern in the questions you receive, it might indicate a topic
      you should add to your HOWTO.

      <para> The easiest way is to find something and document

      </question>
      <answer>
        <para> That's okay.  You have the option of writing your first
        draft of the HOWTO in the format of your choice, then submit
        that to the LDP.  An LDP volunteer will review the document,
        then convert it into DocBook for you.  Once that's done,it will
        be easier for you to maintain the HOWTO.  If you have
        questions, you can always drop a line to the LDP volunteer or the
        LDP Docbook list
        at <email>docbook@en.tldp.org</email>.</para>
