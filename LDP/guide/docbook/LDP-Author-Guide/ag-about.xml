      <title>About this Guide</title>
      <para>This document was started on Aug 26, 1999 by Mark
      F. Komarinski after two day's worth of frustration getting tools
      to work. If even one LDP author is helped by this, then I did my
      job.</para>

			Version 4 of this document was released in late 2003 by Emma Jane
			Hogbin. A complete overhaul of the document was done to separate
			the authoring HOWTOs from the technical HOWTOs. The review took
			approximately six months.

      <para>There are many ways to contribute to the Linux movement
      without actually writing code.  One of the most important is
      writing documentation, allowing each person to share their
      knowledge with thousands of others around the world.  This Guide
      is designed to help you get familiar with how the LDP works, and
      what tools you'll need to write your own HOWTO.</para>
