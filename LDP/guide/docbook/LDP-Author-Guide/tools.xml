    <title>System Setup: Editors, Validation and
	 Transformations</title>

    <para>In this section, we will cover some of the tools
	 that you may want to use to create your own LDP documentation.
    If you use some other tool to assist you in writing
	 documents for the LDP, please drop us a line and we'll
	 add a blurb for it here. The <xref linkend="feedback" />
	 section has contact information.</para>

<!-- 
	Tools to edit your document. 
	Pretty straight forward stuff. I'd like to update
	the screen shots so that they're a printer-friendly
	size. And add screen shots for VIM *hearts to vi* 
	and Morphon and whoever else is missing pretty 
	pictures.
-->
&tools-edit;

<!-- 
	Tools to validate your XML/SGML 
	There will be some duplication in here as 
	editing and validation may or may not be 
	considered the same thing. Mostly I'm keeping
	them separate because I use VIM and all the 
	stuff on emacs is useless to me. ;)
-->
&tools-validate;

<!-- 
	Tools to Transform DocBook to other formats
	Mostly this is a Jade/DSSSL section; but I'd
	like to add some XSLT stuff because...well...
	I found it about 100 times easier to install.
