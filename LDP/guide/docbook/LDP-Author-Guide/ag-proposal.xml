<title>Choosing a Subject</title>

<para>
	It's likely that if you are reading the Author Guide, you already have a
	subject in mind. The idea may have come from your own frustrations in
	trying to get something to work; or maybe you are already writing (or
	have written) documentation for work or a client and you want to submit
	it to the LDP. 
	For example, if you posted a question to a mailing list
	and it took many posts to resolve the problem--there may be a need for
	documentation. 
</para>	
<para>
	Regardless of how your picked your subject, it is 
	important that you feel there is a need for the
	documentation. It also helps if you can convince a few people on the discuss
	mailing list that your proposed documentation will be a valuable
	contribution to the LDP.
	If someone has requested documentation, or you worked
	with a mailing list to resolve a problem you should include the details in
	your proposal to The LDP discuss mailing list. It may help others to
	understand the need for your specific document.
</para>

<para>
	Now that you've got a subject, you will need to decide the
	<quote>scope</quote> of the document. It is best if the subject area
	is:
</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <formalpara>          
            <title>Clearly defined.</title>

            <para>
              Know before you begin exactly where the boundaries of your
              subject area lie. You should not cover the same ground as another
              HOWTO, and you should try not to leave gaps between your HOWTO
              and related HOWTOs, either.
            </para>
          </formalpara>
        </listitem>
        
		<listitem>
          <formalpara>
            <title>Not too broad, and not too narrow.</title>
              <para>
                If you try to cover too much information you may sacrifice depth. 
				It is better to cover a small subject area fully than to cover a large subject
                area poorly. Linux tools are known for doing exactly one
                thing and doing that one thing <emphasis>well</emphasis>. 
                Similarly, your HOWTO should cover one subject and cover it
                <emphasis>well</emphasis>.
              </para>
          </formalpara>

          <para>
            If your subject matter is very small, it might be better
            included as part of another HOWTO. This makes it easier
            for readers to find the HOWTO they need. Search the LDP repository
            for HOWTOs on related topics, and see if you could place
            your information in an existing HOWTO.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        
        <listitem>
          <formalpara>
            <title>Undocumented.</title>
            
            <para>
              Before documenting a particular subject, check other HOWTOs at the LDP,
              and see if the topic is already documented. If it is, refer to the 
              other HOWTO instead of rewriting documentation that already exists.
            </para>
          </formalpara>
      
          <para>
            If the HOWTO already in place is insufficient, or needs updating, 
            contact the author and offer to help. LDP authors are usually nice folks.
            After all, they put in their own valuable time to help people they
            don't even know. And, they appreciate your help. But, please, don't
            duplicate work. It causes confusion for everyone.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        
        <listitem>
          <formalpara>
            <title>Pre-approved by the LDP.</title>
            
            <para>
              Before you proceed with your HOWTO, post to the discuss list
              and get some feedback from other LDP volunteers. Checking with the
              list <emphasis>before</emphasis> you begin can save you headaches
              <emphasis>later</emphasis>. Trust us on this one.
            </para>
          
		  </formalpara>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

<note><para>
	It is a really good idea to join the discuss list, and follow
    it regularly, even if you never post. It's a good way to stay current
    on the activities, needs, and policies of the LDP. In fact it
	should really be considered a pre-requisite to contributing
	(even though it's not).

	<title>Types of Documents</title>
	<para>
	After you've decided what the scope of your document will have you
	should start to consider the format you will use. There are
	a number of different kinds of LDP documentation templates:
	Guides, HOWTOs, mini-HOWTOs, man pages and FAQs. Rahul Sundaram
	describes the scope of each of these types of documents in the <ulink
	url="http://tldp.org/FAQ/LDP-FAQ/index.html">Linux Documentation
	Project (LDP) FAQ</ulink>. Here is a brief overview of what they are
	with pointers on how you can get started writing your own:

<title>Unmaintained and Out-of-date Documents</title>

<para>
  If you wish to become the "owner" for an unmaintained document there are
  several steps you must go through.
</para>

<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>
	      Contact the original author. Make sure the author no longer 
wishes to maintain the document in question. Note that the email address 
shown may no longer be valid. In that case, please try a <ulink
url="http://google.com">search</ulink> for the 
author. If they cannot be found after a <quote>good-faith</quote> effort, 
let us know (<email>feedback@en.tldp.org</email>).
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>
      Determine if a more up-to-date copy of the document exists, outside
of what is available on the LDP. If so, try to secure a copy for yourself
to work on.
   	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>
      Inform the LDP which document you would like to own, so that we can
track who is working on what and prevent duplication of effort. We also
suggest that you join the LDP general discussion list
(<email>discuss@en.tldp.org</email>). This step is also required for new
documents.
	</para></listitem>   

    <listitem><para> 
	Submit the document to the LDP with any intended modifications. Make
sure to continue to reference the original author somewhere within the
document (Credits, Revision History, etc.). Once the document is
re-submitted, we will remove the entry from the list of unmaintained
documents.
	</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<note><para>Some of unmaintained documents may be outdated, or the content may be
covered in another (actively maintained) HOWTO. If that is the situation,
contact us (preferably on the discuss mailing list) and let us know.</para></note>
	
</section>
  
<section id="sg-outline">
    <title>Developing an Outline</title>
    
    <para>
      Before you actually begin writing, prepare an outline.
      An outline will help you get a clear picture of the subject matter,
      and allow you to concentrate on one small part of the HOWTO
      at a time.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Unless your HOWTO is exceptionally small, your outline will probably
      be multilevel.
      When developing a multilevel outline, the top level should contain general
      subject areas, and sub-headings should be more detailed and specific.
      Look at each level of your outline independently,
      and make sure it covers all key areas of the subject matter. Sub-headings
      should cover all key areas of the heading under which they fall.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Each item in your outline should follow the item before it,
      and lead into the item that comes next. For example, a HOWTO about a particular
      program shouldn't have a section on <emphasis>configuration</emphasis>
      before one on <emphasis>installation</emphasis>.</para>
	  
	  <para>You may choose to use the following outline for a HOWTO about
	  using a specific program:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>development history</para></listitem>
		
	  <listitem><para>where to download the software from</para></listitem>
	  
	  <listitem><para>how to install the software</para></listitem>
	  
	  <listitem><para>how to configure the software</para></listitem>
	  
	  <listitem><para>how to use the software</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
	
	<para>You may find it helpful to try a little <quote>card
	sorting</quote> at this stage of the writing process. Write all of your mini
	subject areas onto pieces of paper. Now sort these pieces of paper into
	main headings and their sub-sections. It may help to shuffle the slips of
	paper before you start. This will help to give you a fresh set of eyes
	while working.
	</para>
	
    <para>
      When you are comfortable with your outline, look over it once more,
      with a critical eye. Have you covered every relevant topic in
      sufficient detail? Have you wandered beyond the scope of the HOWTO?
      It's a good idea to show your outline to others (including The LDP
	  discuss list) to get some feedback.
      It's much easier to reorganize your HOWTO at the outline stage 
	  than it is to reorganizing your document after writing it. 
    </para>
    
    <note>
      <para>
        You might have noticed a theme developing here.
        Just like Free software, Free documentation is best when you
        <quote>release early, release often.</quote> The discuss list includes
        many experienced LDP authors, and you would be wise to seek their
        advice when making decisions about your HOWTO.

<section id="research">
<!-- Section added by EJH: August 12, 2003 -->
<title>Research</title>
	<para>
	  While you are working on your outline you will most likely research 
	  your topic (especially to confirm the document you are about to 
	  write doesn't already exist!). Here are a few pointers that will keep
	  you from pulling out your hair later:
	</para>

	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<formalpara>
			<title>Compile your resources as you research.</title>
			<para>It is almost guarenteed you will not remember where to
			find a critical piece of information when you need it most. It
			will help to bookmark important (and even not so important)
			pages as you go. If the title of the document doesn't describe
			the information that is relevent to you then you should add
			notes on why the page is important. 
			If there are two key ideas you may want to bookmark the
			same page with two different titles.</para>
			</formalpara>
		</listitem>

		<listitem>
			<formalpara>
			<title>Assume your most important resource will disappear.</title>
			<para>The dreaded 404: Page not found. Even if you have
			bookmarked a page it may not be there when you return to it. If
			a page contains a really critical piece of information: make a
			copy. You may do this by creating a text file with the title of 
			the document, the author's name, the page's URL and the text of 
			the page into a text file on your computer. You might also
			choose to <quote>print</quote> the file to a PDF (this will
			capture the original URL on the page if you're using a smart
			browser).</para>
			</formalpara>
		</listitem>

		<listitem>
			<formalpara>
			<title>Start your <quote>Resources</quote> page now.</title>
			<para>As you find pages of interest add them to a Resources
			document. You may do this by exporting your bookmarks or by
			keeping a separate text file with the Resources sorted by
			sub-category. A little effort now will save you a lot of time
			later.</para>
			</formalpara>
		</listitem>
		
		<listitem>
			<formalpara>
			<title>Write down subject areas as you go.</title>
			<para>If you are card sorting you may find it particularly
			useful to write topic cards as you find pages that cover that
			specific topic. At the top of the card write the subject area.
			In the main area of the card write a few notes about what you
			might cover under this topic--include the titles of pages that
			contain important information. If a sub-topic gets too big you
			may want to divide it into multiple cards.</para>
			</formalpara>
		</listitem>
		
		<listitem>
			<formalpara>
			<title>Separate generic information from version-specific
			information.</title>
			<para>The day after you finish your HOWTO a new version of the
			software will be released. Some things, like where to download
			the software, won't change. Other things will. You may also
			choose to document old problems with specific software as a way
			of encouraging people to upgrade their old versions. e.g.
			<quote>Version X of the software is known for a specific bug.
			The bug was fixed as of Version Y.</quote>
			</para>
			</formalpara>
		</listitem>
	
		<listitem>
			<formalpara>
			<title>Save all related emails.</title>
			<para>People will often have interesting insight into the
			problem you're writing about. Any questions that are asked
			about your topic should be addressed in the final document. If
			you are writing about software make sure to ask people what
			system they are using if their setup was different from your
			own. All of these personal experiences with your topic can add
			greatly to your final documentation.</para>
