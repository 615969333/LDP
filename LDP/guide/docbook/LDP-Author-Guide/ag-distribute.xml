<title>Before Distributing Your Documentation</title>
	<para>
		Before you distribute your documentation, there are a few more

	</para>

	<variablelist>
	<varlistentry>
	<term>Spelling and Grammar Check</term>
	<listitem>
	<para>

	<varlistentry>
	<term>Abstract and Other Meta Data</term>
	<listitem>
	<para>

	<varlistentry>
	<term>License and Copyright</term>
	<listitem>
	<para>
		The LDP distributes documents, however, the author maintains the
		copyright on the document. All documents accepted by the LDP must
		contain a license and copyright notice. You can read more about this
		in <xref linkend="doc-copyright" />.
		You may also want to add a Disclaimer, but this is optional. More
		about this in <xref linkend="doc-disclaimer" />.
	</para>
	</listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	<term>Validate the Markup</term>
	<listitem>
	<para>
		If you are submitting a DocBook or LinuxDoc document, make sure the
		markup is valid. Read why in <xref linkend="why-validate" />.
	</para>
	</listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	
	<varlistentry>
	<term>Obtain Peer Reviews</term>
	<listitem>
	<para>
		You may want to have others review your document before
		submitting it to the LDP. Ask people for a <ulink
		url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LDP-Reviewer-HOWTO/peerreview.html">Peer
		Review</ulink> and/or a <ulink
		url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LDP-Reviewer-HOWTO/techreview.html">Technical
		Accuracy Review</ulink>. Since not all mailing lists will respond favorably 
		to attachments, you may wish to set up a temporary web site which houses your
		document. Note: this is absolutely <emphasis>not</emphasis> required.

<section id="document-components">
    <title>Document Components</title>
		
	<para>
		In addition to the main text of your document, there are a few
		additional sections you will need to add to your document before it
		can be distributed.
	</para>
	
	 <section id="doc-copyright">
      <title>Copyright and Licensing issues</title>
      <para> In order for a document to be accepted by the LDP,
      it must be licensed and conform to the <quote>LICENSE
		REQUIREMENTS</quote>
      section of the LDP Manifesto located at <ulink
      url="http://www.tldp.org/manifesto.html">http://www.tldp.org/manifesto.html</ulink>.
      As an author, you may retain the copyright and add other
      restrictions (for example: require approval any translations or
      derivative works). </para>

      <note><para> We recommend using the <ulink 
      url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">GNU Free Documentation 
      License (GFDL)</ulink> or the <ulink 
      url="http://opencontent.org/openpub/">Open Publication License 
      (OPL)</ulink> <emphasis>without</emphasis> options A and B.  If
      you choose, you can get DocBook markups of both the GNU GPL
      and the GNU FDL from <ulink url="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gdp/licenses.html">
      the GNOME Documentation Project</ulink>.  You can then merely
      include the license in its entirety in your document. A
		DocBook-formatted copy of the license is available in
		<xref linkend="templates"/>.
		</para></note>
      
      <para>If you choose to use a boilerplate copyright, simply copy it
      into your source code under a section called <quote>Copyright
      and Licenses</quote> or similar. Also include a copyright
      statement of your own (since you still own it). If you are a new
      maintainer of an already-existing HOWTO, you must include the
      previous copyright statements of the previous author(s) and the
      dates they maintained that document. </para> 

      <para>You'll note that the licensing for this guide
      requires notification to the author of any derivative works or
      translations.</para>

		<tip><para>
      If your HOWTO includes bits of source code that you want others to use,
      you may choose to release the source code under GPL.</para></tip>

		<note><para>

			resources section: <xref linkend="ref-licenses" />.

	 <section id="doc-disclaimer">
		<title>Disclaimer</title>
		<para>If you would like to include a disclaimer, you may choose
		to use the following:</para>

		<blockquote>
		<para>
        No liability for the contents of this document can be
			accepted.
        Use the concepts, examples and information at your own risk.
        There may be errors and inaccuracies, that could be damaging
			to
        your system. Proceed with caution, and although this is highly
        unlikely, the author(s) do not take any responsibility.
		</para>

		<para>
        All copyrights are held by their by their respective owners,
        unless specifically noted otherwise. Use of a term in this
        document should not be regarded as affecting the validity of
			any
        trademark or service mark. Naming of particular products or
        brands should not be seen as endorsements.
		</para>
		</blockquote>

<section id="crediting-ack">
	<title>Acknowledgments</title>

   <para>Your document should have an <quote>Acknowledgments</quote> section,
      in which you mention everyone who has contributed to your document in
      any meaningful way. You should include translators and converters, as well as
      people who have sent you lots of good feedback, perhaps the person who taught
      you the knowledge you are now passing on, and anybody else who was instrumental
      in making the document what it is. Most authors put this section at the end
      of their document.
	</para>
    
	 <para>When someone else assists in the production of an
	 LDP document,
    you should give them proper attribution, and there are DocBook tags
    designed to do this. This section will show you the tags you should
    use, as well as other ways of giving credit where credit is due.
    Crediting editors is easy - there is already an
    <sgmltag class="starttag">editor</sgmltag>tag in DocBook.
    But there are two special cases where you need to credit someone,
    but DocBook doesn't provide a special tag. These are <emphasis>translators</emphasis>
    and <emphasis>converters</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>A <emphasis>converter</emphasis> is someone
    who performs a source code conversion, e.g., from HTML to DocBook XML.
    Source code conversions help the LDP achieve long term goals for meta-data,
    and allow us to distribute documentation in many different formats.</para>

    <para>Translators take your original document and translate it into other
    human-readable languages, e.g., from English to Japanese, or from German
    to English. Each translation allows many more people all over the world
    to make use of your document, and helps Linux achieve the ultimate goal -
    Total World Domination(tm)!</para>

		<para>
		We recommend that 
		you acknowledge converters in the comment for the
      initial version released in the new format, and 
		we recommend that you credit translators in each 
		version which they have translated.</para>

	<note><para>For more information on how to add these credits using DocBook
		please read <xref linkend="metadata-markup" />
