    <section id="beforeyoudistribute">
      <title> Before you distribute </title>
      <para> Before you distribute your code to millions of potential
      readers there are a few things you should do. </para> 
      <para> First, be sure to spell-check your document. Most
      utilities that you would use to write SGML have plug-ins to
      perform a spell check. If not, there's always the aspell
      program. </para> 
      <para> Second, get someone to review your documentation for
      factual correctness.  You can also ask for general
      comments.  The documentation that is
      published by the LDP needs to be as factually correct as
      possible, as there are millions of Linux users that may be
      reading it. If you're part of a larger mailing list talking
      about the subject, ask others from the list to help you
      out. </para> 
      <para> Third, create a web site where you can distribute your
      documentation. This isn't required, but is helpful for people to
      find the original location of your document. </para>

      <title> Copyright and Licensing issues </title>
      <para> In order for an LDP document to be accepted by the LDP,
      it must be licensed to conform to the "LICENSE REQUIREMENTS"
      section of the LDP Manifesto located at <ulink
      url="http://www.tldp.org/manifesto.html">http://www.tldp.org/manifesto.html</ulink>.
      As an author, you may retain the copyright and add other
      restrictions (for example, you must approve any translations or
      derivative works). </para>

      <para> We recommend using the <ulink 
      url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">GNU Free Documentation 
      License (GFDL)</ulink> or the <ulink 
      url="http://opencontent.org/openpub/">Open Publication License 
      (OPL)</ulink> <emphasis>without</emphasis> options A and B.  If
      you choose, you can get DocBook markups of both the GNU GPL
      and the GNU FDL from <ulink url="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gdp/licenses.html">
      the GNOME Documentation Project</ulink>.  You can then merely
      include the license in its entirety in your document.  Due
      to its length, you may just want to provide a link
      to the source.</para>
      
      <para>If you choose to use a boilerplate copyright, simply copy it
      into your source code under a section called <quote>Copyright
      and Licenses</quote> or similar. Also include a copyright
      statement of your own (since you still own it). If you are a new
      maintainer of an already-existing HOWTO, you must include the
      previous copyright statements of the previous author(s) and the
      dates they maintained that document. </para> 

      <para>You'll note that the licensing for the LDP Author Guide
      requires notification to the author of any derivative works or
      translations.  I also explicitly place any source code (aside
      from the SGML the Guide was written in) under the GPL. If your
      HOWTO includes bits of source code that you want others to use,
      you may do the same.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="submission">
      <title> Submission to LDP </title>
      <para> Once your LDP document has been carefully reviewed, you
      can release your document to the LDP. Send an e-mail with the
      SGML source code as an attachment (you may gzip it if you like)
      to <email>submit@en.tldp.org</email>. </para> 

      <para> Be sure to include the name of your HOWTO in the subject
      line, and use the body to outline changes you've made and attach
      your HOWTO. This allows the maintainers to do their jobs faster,
      so you will not have to wait for your HOWTO to be updated on the
      LDP web site. If you don't hear anything in 5 calendar days,
      please follow up with an e-mail to make sure things are still in
      process. </para> 

      <para>If your HOWTO contains extras, such as graphics or a
      special catalog, create a.tar.gz file with all the files in it
      including the .xml source code and mail it as an attachment to
      the submit list.</para>

      <para>If you are using the LDP CVS tree while developing
      your document, the LDP will still need to be notified when your
      document is ready to be published. E-mail should be sent to
      <email>submit@en.tldp.org</email>. Indicate
      the title of your document and the relative path to the
      file(s) in the LDP CVS tree within your message. </para>

    <section id="crediting-ack">
      <title>The <quote>Acknowledgements</quote> section</title>

      <para>Your document should have an <quote>Acknowledgements</quote> section,
      in which you mention everyone who has contributed to your document in
      any meaningful way. You should include translators and converters, as well as
      people who have sent you lots of good feedback, perhaps the person who taught
      you the knowledge you are now passing on, and anybody else who was instrumental
      in making the document what it is. Most authors put this section at the end
      of their document.</para>
    </section>
    
	 <para>When someone else assists in the production of an
	 LDP document,
    you should give them proper attribution, and there are DocBook tags
    designed to do this. This section will show you the tags you should
    use, as well as other ways of giving credit where credit is due.
    Crediting editors is easy - there is already an
    <sgmltag class="starttag">editor</sgmltag>tag in DocBook.
    But there are two special cases where you need to credit someone,
    but DocBook doesn't provide a special tag. These are <emphasis>translators</emphasis>
    and <emphasis>converters</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>A <emphasis>converter</emphasis> is someone
    who performs a source code conversion, e.g., from HTML to DocBook SGML.
    Source code conversions help the LDP achieve long term goals for meta-data,
    and allow us to produce documentation in many different output formats.</para>

    <para>Translators take your original document and translate it into other
    human-readable languages, e.g., from English to Japanese, or from German
    to English. Each translation allows many more people all over the world
    to make use of your document, and helps Linux achieve the ultimate goal -
    Total World Domination(tm)!</para>

		<para>
		We recommend that 
		you acknowledge converters in the comment for the
      initial version released in the new format, and 
		we recommend that you credit translators in each 
		version which they have translated.</para>

      <question>
        <para> I found an error in an LDP document. Can I fix it? </para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para> Contact the author of the document, or the LDP
        coordinator at <email>feedback@en.tldp.org</email> and
        mention the problem and how you think it needs to be
        fixed. </para>

      <question>
        <para>But I don't know SGML/Can't get the tools working/Don't
        like SGML</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para> That's okay.  You have the option of writing your first
        draft of the HOWTO in the format of your choice, then submit
        that to the LDP.  An LDP volunteer will review the document,
        then convert it into DocBook for you.  Once that's done,it will
        be easier for you to maintain the HOWTO.  If you have
        questions, you can always drop a line to the LDP volunteer or the
        LDP Docbook list
        at <email>docbook@en.tldp.org</email>.</para>
