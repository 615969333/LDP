<title>Before Distributing Your Documentation</title>
	<para>

	<listitem>
	<para>
		The LDP distributes documents, however, the author maintains the

		contain a license and copyright notice. You can read more about this
		in <xref linkend="doc-copyright" />.
		You may also want to add a Disclaimer, but this is optional. More
		about this in <xref linkend="doc-disclaimer" />.

	<term>Validate the Markup</term>

	<varlistentry>
	<term>Obtain Peer Reviews</term>
	<listitem>
	<para>
		You may want to have others review your document before
		submitting it to the LDP. Ask people for a <ulink

		Review</ulink> and/or a <ulink
		url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LDP-Reviewer-HOWTO/techreview.html">Technical
		Accuracy Review</ulink>. Since not all mailing lists will respond favorably 
		to attachments, you may wish to set up a temporary web site which houses your
		document. Note: this is absolutely <emphasis>not</emphasis> required.

    <title>Document Components</title>
		
	<para>
		In addition to the main text of your document, there are a few
		additional sections you will need to add to your document before it
		can be distributed.
	</para>
	
	 <section id="doc-copyright">
      <title>Copyright and Licensing issues</title>
      <para> In order for a document to be accepted by the LDP,
      it must be licensed and conform to the <quote>LICENSE
		REQUIREMENTS</quote>
      section of the LDP Manifesto located at <ulink
      url="http://www.tldp.org/manifesto.html">http://www.tldp.org/manifesto.html</ulink>.
      As an author, you may retain the copyright and add other
      restrictions (for example: require approval for any translations or
      derivative works). </para>

      <note><title>Get a copy of the license</title><para> We recommend using the <ulink 
      url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">GNU Free Documentation 
      License (GFDL)</ulink>. If 
      you choose, you can get DocBook markups of both the GNU GPL
      and the GNU FDL from <ulink url="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gdp/licenses.html">
      the GNOME Documentation Project</ulink>.  You can then merely
      include the license in its entirety in your document. A
		DocBook-formatted copy of the license is available in
		<xref linkend="templates"/>.
		</para></note>
      
      <para>If you choose to use a boilerplate copyright, simply copy it
      into your source code under a section called <quote>Copyright
      and Licenses</quote> or similar. Also include a copyright
      statement of your own (since you still own it). If you are a new
      maintainer of an already-existing HOWTO, you must include the
      previous copyright statements of the previous author(s) and the
      dates they maintained that document. </para>

		to use the following:</para>

		<blockquote>
		&disclaimer;
		</blockquote>

<section id="crediting-ack">
	<title>Acknowledgments</title>

   <para>Your document should have an <quote>Acknowledgments</quote> section,
      in which you mention everyone who has contributed to your document in
      any meaningful way. You should include translators and converters, as well as
      people who have sent you lots of good feedback, perhaps the person who taught
      you the knowledge you are now passing on, and anybody else who was instrumental
      in making the document what it is. Most authors put this section at the end
      of their document.
	</para>
    
	 <para>When someone else assists in the production of an
	 LDP document,
    you should give them proper attribution, and there are DocBook tags
    designed to do this. This section will show you the tags you should
    use, as well as other ways of giving credit where credit is due.
    Crediting editors is easy - there is already an
    <sgmltag class="starttag">editor</sgmltag>tag in DocBook.
    But there are two special cases where you need to credit someone,
    but DocBook doesn't provide a special tag. These are <emphasis>translators</emphasis>
    and <emphasis>converters</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>A <emphasis>converter</emphasis> is someone
    who performs a source code conversion, for instance from HTML to DocBook XML.
    Source code conversions help the LDP achieve long term goals for meta-data,
    and allow us to distribute documentation in many different formats.</para>

    <para>Translators take your original document and translate it into other
    human-readable languages, from English to Japanese for example, or from German
    to English. Each translation allows many more people all over the world
    to make use of your document and of the Linux operating system!</para>

		<para>
		We recommend that 
		you acknowledge converters in the comment for the
      initial version released in the new format, and 
		we recommend that you credit translators in each 
		version which they have translated.</para>

<section id="ag-review">
<title>TLDP Review Process</title>

<para>
	Before your document is accepted to the LDP collection it will undergo
	at least two formal reviews. These reviews include a <ulink
	url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LDP-Reviewer-HOWTO/techreview.html">technical accuracy
	review</ulink> and a <ulink
	url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LDP-Reviewer-HOWTO/languagereview.html">language review</ulink>. Each new document must pass both of these reviews
	before it is accepted to the collection.
</para>

<para>
	When you feel your document is finished, email a copy to the submit
	mailing list. The review coordinator will assign you a team of
	volunteers who will conduct the reviews of your document. It may take
	up to a week to gather a team who is qualified to review your document.
	Typically the technical review happens first, followed by the language
	review. Your reviewers will read your document give you feedback on
	whether or not they think your document is ready for publication in the
	LDP collection.
</para>

<para>
	Your reviewers may have specific points that must be changed. Once you
	have made the changes submit your document back to your review team.
	They will review the document again and advise you on whether or not
	your document is ready for inclusion in the LDP collection. You may
	need to undergo several edits before your document is ready. Or it may
	not require any additional work. Be prepared to make at least one round
	of changes for both the technical and language reviews.
</para>

<para>
	Once your document has passed both the technical and language reviews,
	you may submit it by following the instructions in <xref
	linkend="submission" />.
</para>

<para>
	For more information on what the reviewers will be looking for, please
	read the <ulink
