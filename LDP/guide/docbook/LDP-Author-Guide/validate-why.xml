	<title>Why Validate Your Document</title>

	<para>
		The LDP uses a number of scripts to distribute your document.
		These scripts submit your document to the LDP's CVS (like a content
		management system), and then they transform your document to other formats that
		users then read. Your document will also be mirrored on a number
		of sites worldwide (yet another set of scripts).
	</para>
	
	<para>
		In order for these scripts to work correctly, your document must 
		be both <quote>well formed</quote> (grammatically correct) use <quote>valid
		markup</quote> (spell checked). 
		<emphasis>Well formed</emphasis> means your document follows the rules that XML
		is expecting--this is the grammar part. <emphasis>Valid
		markup</emphasis> means you only use elements or tags
		which are <quote>valid</quote> for your
		document--this is the spelling part. 
	</para>

	<para>
		If your document is not well formed, and valid, the
		scripts will not be able to process your document. As
		a result, your document will not be distributed.
