	<title>Why Validate Your Document</title>

	<para>
		The LDP uses a number of scripts to distribute your document.
		These scripts submit your document to the CVS (like a content
		management system), and then transform your document to other formats that
		users then read. Your document will also be mirrored on a number
		of sites worldwide (yet another set of scripts).
	</para>
	
	<para>
		In order for these scripts to work correctly, your document must 
		be both <quote>well formed</quote> (grammatically correct) using <quote>valid
		markup</quote> (spell checked). 
		Well formed means your document follows the (grammar) rules that XML
		is expecting. Valid markup means you only use elements or tags
		(spelling) which are <quote>valid</quote> for your document. The
		spelling (valid markup) depends on which DOCTYPE is used for your
		document.
	</para>

	<para>
		If your document is not well formed, and valid, the scripts will
		not be able to process your document. As a result, your document
		will not be distributed.
