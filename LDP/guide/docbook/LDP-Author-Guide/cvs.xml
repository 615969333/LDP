This section is now a set of commands (only) and is moved to
an appendix. The original "intro" has been moved to the 
writing section.

I've removed the Creating Tag Releases section. My guess is that
either someone is familiar enough with CVS to add tags, or they're
not. And if they're not this document should not overwhelm them into
thinking it's important.

If anything the person setting up the CVS account could set a new
branch if someone is taking over the documentation.

   <para>
      You can browse the LDP CVS repository via the web at <ulink
        url="http://cvsview.tldp.org/">http://cvsview.tldp.org/</ulink>.

    <section id="getaccount">
      <title> Getting a CVS account </title>
      <para> First you'll need to get an account at the LDP's CVS
      Repository. This is pretty much the root directory that is used
      by CVS, with various projects (HOWTOs, guides, etc.)
      created as subdirectories of it. </para>
      <para>Please fill the form:
         <ulink url="http://tldp.org/cvs/">
            http://tldp.org/cvs/</ulink>
      </para>
      <para>During filling the form we want you to inform us about
      your plans, eg. which HOWTO you maintain.
      </para>
      <para>Your unique
      CVSROOT directory will be created and you'll get an e-mail with
      a response. Remember your password, it will <emphasis>not</emphasis>
     be sent in the email. When you get your response, log into your CVSROOT
      and make sure everything is set up properly. Use either of these
		options:</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
			<para>
			<command>export CVSROOT=:pserver:<replaceable>your_userid</replaceable>@cvs.tldp.org:/cvsroot</command>
      	<command>cvs -d $CVSROOT login</command>
      	</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem><para>
            <command>cvs 
				-d :pserver:<replaceable>your_userid</replaceable>@cvs.tldp.org:/cvsroot
            login
           </command></para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

      <para> (Replace the <replaceable>your_userid</replaceable> with what
      you were sent in the response e-mail). </para>
      <para> You will be asked for your password, and then be given
      access to the CVS Repository in read-write mode. Wait patiently
      while the system tries to log you in. It can often take more
      that 10-20 seconds for the system to either accept (or reject)
      your password. Once you've
      used <command moreinfo="none">cvs login</command> once and have
      been given access to the system, your password is stored in
      <filename moreinfo="none">.cvspass</filename> and you will not
      have to use <command moreinfo="none">cvs login</command>
      again. Just set the CVSROOT with the export command listed above
      and continue on.</para>

      <para>
         You can get the entire repository with: <command>cvs get LDP</command>
		</para>

      <para> Or you can get the source for your own document with:
			<command>cvs get LDP/howto/docbook/YOUR-HOWTO.sgml</command>
			<command>cvs get guide/docbook/YOURGUIDE</command>
		</para>

   <note><para>
      <command>get</command> will add the full directory structure
      from tldp.org on down. Although it doesn't really matter where
      you put these files on your local filesystem you may not want to
      bury the directories too deeply.

		As with the add command, you need to <quote>commit</quote> your
		removed file. Finally, now that the old file has been removed, add

        <title>Recovering old versions</title>
        <para>
          There you are, typing away, when you screw up.  Real bad.
          Doesn't matter what it is, but suffice it to say that you've
          toasted not only the version on your local drive, but
          created a new version on the CVS server.  What you need
          to do is go back in time and resurrect and older
          version of your file.
        </para>
        <para>
          To do this, you'll need to know the version number of the
          file you want to retrieve. <command>cvs diff</command>
          will give a list of revisions if there are differences.  You
          can pick the revision number, subtract one, and that is
          probably the revision you want to look at.
        </para>
        <para>
          The command <command>cvs -Q update -p -r <replaceable>revision</replaceable></command>
          <replaceable>filename</replaceable> will output to stdout
          the contents of the <replaceable>revision</replaceable> version
          of <replaceable>filename</replaceable>.  You can pipe it to
          <command>more</command> or redirect the output to a file.
          Conveniently, you can redirect stdout to a file called
          <replaceable>filename</replaceable>.  Your local file
          is now the revision you want, and <command>cvs update
          </command> will update the CVS server with the new (old)
          version of <replaceable>filename</replaceable>.
