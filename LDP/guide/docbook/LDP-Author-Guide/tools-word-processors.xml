<para>
	Even if you aren't comfortable working DocBook's tagset
	in a text editor you can still produce valid DocBook
	documents using a word processor. Support at this point
	is very limited, but it does exist in the following
	programs. The up side, of course, is that things like
	spellcheck are built in to the program. In addition to
	this, support for DocBook (and XML) is constantly
	improving.

	Through word of mouth I've heard that AbiWord can work
	(natively) with DocBook documents. This will need to be
	tested by someone (possibly me) and should definitely be
	included if it is the case.

<para>
	As of OpenOffice.org (OOo) 1.1RC there has been
	support for exporting files to DocBook format.
</para>

<para>
	Although
	OOo uses the full DocBook document type declaration, it
	does not actually export the full list of DocBook
	elements. It uses a <quote>simplified</quote> DocBook
	tagset which is geared to on-the-fly rendering. (Although
	it is not the official Simplified DocBook which is
	described in <xref linkend="dtds" />.)
  The OpenOffice simplified (or "special" docbook) is
  available from

	</ulink>. 
</para>

<para>
	OOo has been tested by LDP volunteers with mostly
	positive results. Thanks to Charles Curley 
		(<a href="http://www.charlescurley.com">charlescurley.com</a>) 
	for the following notes:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
	To be able to export to DocBook, you must have a Java runtime
  environment (JRE) installed and registered with OOo--a
  minimum of version 4.2.x is recommended. The configuration
  instructions will depend on how you installed your JRE.
  Visit the OOo web site for help with your setup.
</para>

<para>
  Contrary to the OOo documentation, the Linux OOo did not come with a
  JRE. I got one from Sun.
</para>
</listitem> <!-- openoffice -->

<listitem><para>
	The exported file has lots of empty lines. My 54 line exported file
  had 5 lines of actual XML code.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
	There was no effort at pretty printing.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The header is:
    <computeroutput>
	 &lt;?xml version=3D"1.0" encoding=3D"UTF-8"?&gt;
    &lt;!DOCTYPE article PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2//EN" 
	 "http:/=/www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.1.2/docbookx.dtd"&gt;
	</computeroutput>
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The pull-down menu in the "Save As" dialog box for file format
  indicates that the export format is "DocBook (simplified)." There is
  no explanation of what that "simplified" indicates. Does OOo export
  a subset of DocBook? If so, which elements are ignored? Is there any
  way to enter any of them manually?
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
There is NO documentation on the DocBook export filter or whether
  OOo will import it again.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
	Conclusions: OOo 1.1RC is worth looking at if you want a word
	processor for preparing DocBook documents.
</para>

<para>
	However, I hope they cure the lack of documentation. 
	For one thing, it would be nice to know which native OOo 
	styles map to which DocBook elements. It would also be 
	nice to know how to map one's own OOo styles to DocBook elements.

	<!-- what about XML capabilities? Please replace if

	WordPerfect 9 for the MS Windows platform has support

   capabilities.
</para>
<para>
	This is the least expensive of the commercial
