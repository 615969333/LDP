      <title>Acknowledgments and Thanks</title>
      <para>Thanks to everyone that gave comments as I was writing
      this. This includes David Lawyer, Deb Richardson, Daniel Barlow,
      Greg Ferguson, Mark Craig and other members of the
      <email>discuss@en.tldp.org</email> list. Some
      sections I got from the <ulink
      url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/">HOWTO Index</ulink> and the
      sgmltools documentation. The sections on network access to CVS
      was partially written by Sergiusz Pawlowicz
      (<email>ser@metalab.unc.edu</email>). Sections on DocBook
      were written by Jorge Godoy
      (<email>godoy@conectiva.com</email>). A great deal of thanks
      to both of them for their help.</para>
