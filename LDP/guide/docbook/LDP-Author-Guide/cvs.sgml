    <para> The LDP is in the process of providing CVS access to
    authors. There are a few good reasons for this: </para> 

    <orderedlist inheritnum="ignore" continuation="restarts">
      <listitem>
        <para> CVS will keep an off-site backup of your documents. In
        the event that you hand over a document to another author,
        they can just retrieve the document from CVS and continue
        on. In the event you need to go back to a previous version of
        a document, you can retrieve it as well.  </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para> It's great if you have many people working on the same
        document. You can have CVS tell you what changes were made
        while you were editing your copy by another author, and
        integrate those changes in.  </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para> Keeps a log of what changes were made. These logs (and
        a date stamp) can be placed automatically inside the document
        when you use some special tags that get processed before the
        SGML processor.  </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para> Can provide for a way for a program to automatically
      update the LDP web site with new documentation as it's written
      and submitted. This is not in place yet, but is a potential
      goal. Currently, CVS updates signal the HOWTO coordinator to
      update the LDP web page, meaning that if you use CVS, you're not
      required to e-mail your SGML code. </para> 
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para> If you're completely new to CVS, there are a few web pages
    you may want to look at which can help you out: </para>

    <section id="getaccount">
      <title> Getting a CVS account </title>
      <para> First you'll need to get an account at the LDP's CVS
      Repository. This is pretty much the root directory that is used
      by CVS, with various projects (HOWTOs, mini HOWTOs, etc.)
      created as subdirectories of that. </para> 
      <para> You will need to create a hashed password and userid for
      your account. The hashed password allows you to send an
      encrypted password to the CVS group without them needing to know
      your password. You can do this with the following command, from
      bash (or sh): </para> 

      <screen format="linespecific">
<prompt>bash$</prompt> <command>echo your_password | perl -e "print crypt(&lt;&gt;,\
join '',('.', '/', 0..9, 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z')[rand 64, rand 64]),\"\n\""</command>
</screen>

      <para>Take the output of this command, and send it with your
      proposed userid to
      <email>cvsadmin@cvslist.linuxdoc.org</email>. Your unique
      CVSROOT directory will be created and you'll get an e-mail with
      a response. When you get your response, log into your CVSROOT
      and make sure everything is set up properly: </para> 

      <screen format="linespecific">
<prompt>bash$</prompt> <command>export CVSROOT=:pserver:<replaceable>your_userid</replaceable>@cvs.linuxdoc.org:/cvsroot</command>
<prompt>bash$</prompt> <command>cvs -d $CVSROOT login</command>
</screen>

      <para> (Replace the <replaceable>your_userid</replaceable> with what
      you were sent in the response e-mail). </para> 
      <para> You will be asked for your password, and then given
      access to the CVS Repository in read-write mode. Once you've
      used <command moreinfo="none">cvs login</command> once and have
      been given access to the system, your password is stored in
      <filename moreinfo="none">.cvspass</filename> and you will not
      have to use <command moreinfo="none">cvs login</command>
      again. Just set the CVSROOT and continue on. You can get the
      entire LinuxDoc repository with this command:  </para> 

      <screen>
<prompt>bash$</prompt> <command>cvs get LDP</command>
</screen>

      <para> Or you can get the SGML source for your own document with
      these commands: </para> 

      <screen format="linespecific">
<prompt>bash$</prompt> <command>cvs get howto/YOUR-HOWTO.sgml</command>
<prompt>bash$</prompt> <command>cvs get
minihowto/YOURDOC.sgml</command>

      <section id="anoncvs">
        <title> Anonymous CVS access </title>
        <para> Anonymous CVS access is available for those who do not
        require an account (such as those wishing to publish LDP
        documents). This repository is read-only: </para> 

        <screen>
<prompt>bash$</prompt> <command>cvs -d :pserver:cvs@anoncvs.linuxdoc.org:/cvsroot login</command>
</screen>

        <para> As a password, use cvs. You can then get LinuxDoc
        modules as above. Note that changes to the anoncvs site may be
        a half an hour behind the main site. </para>

    <section id="updatefiles">
      <title> Updating files and CVS </title>
      <para> CVS has a special tag, <emphasis>$Id</emphasis>, that you
      can use to automatically insert the date and version directly
      into the document. After committing, CVS will turn this tag into
      <emphasis>$Id: HOWTO-HOWTO.sgml,v 1.4 2000/06/12 20:49:54 markk
      Exp $</emphasis>. By including this tag in your document, you
      can have that automatically change each time you change the
      file, allowing the revision mark to increment each time. </para> 
      <para> When you're ready to upload changes to the CVS server,
      use the command <command moreinfo="none">cvs ci -m
      &quot;comment&quot; YOUR-HOWTO.sgml</command>. The -m
      &quot;comment&quot; isn't necessary, but if you don't include
      it, you'll be brought into the editor (usually vi, or whatever
      your <envar>EDITOR</envar> environment variable is) and be given
      the chance to add a comment about the changes. </para> 
      <para> You can follow more of the CVS discussion on the
      ldp-discuss list. </para>
      <para>If you are using the LDP CVS tree while developing your
      document, the LDP will need to be notified when your
      document is ready to be published. E-mail should be sent to
      <email>ldp-submit@lists.linuxdoc.org</email>. Indicate
      the title of your document and the relative path to the
      file(s) in the LDP CVS tree within your message. </para>
