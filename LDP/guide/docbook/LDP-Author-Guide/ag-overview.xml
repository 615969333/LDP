<title>Summary of The LDP Process</title>
<para>
	The following section outlines the process of creating and/or
	maintaining a document for the Linux Documentation Project. This
	section includes all steps--some of which may not be relevant to your
	specific document.
</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
	The first thing all new authors should do is join the discussion
	mailing list at <ulink url="http://lists.tldp.org">http://lists.tldp.org</ulink>.
	Authors who are interested in taking over the maintenance of someone
	else's document should also join this list. 
   This is to make sure the LDP knows who is working on what documentation.
	For more information about the mailing lists, please read <xref
	linkend="mailinglists" />.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
	Email the discuss mailing list. Briefly introduce yourself and the topic you
	plan to write about. For more information about writing proposals,
	please read <xref linkend="propose" />
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
	Write your document. You may choose whatever format you feel most
	comfortable in. If it is not one of the formats accepted by the LDP a
	volunteer will convert it for you. For more information on writing
	technical documentation, please read <xref linkend="write" />.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
	If you are adding your own markup, you may also want to join the
	docbook mailing list.
	For more information about the LDP DocBook list please read 
		<xref linkend="mailinglists"/>.
	If you would like to start with a template, you may find the templates in 
	<xref linkend="templates" /> useful. There is also a general
	introduction to markup in <xref linkend="ag-markup" /> and a section
	full of examples at <xref linkend="using-docbook" />.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
	Submit your document for technical and language reviews. Do this by
	emailing your document to <email>submit@en.tldp.org</email>. In the
	subject line be sure give the title of the document. In the body of the
	email say that you are ready for the review process. Outline any
	additional reviews your document may have already received. You should
	be assigned a reviewer within the week. The reviews may take an
	additional week each. For more information about this process, please
	read <xref linkend="distribute" />.
</para>
<para>
	If your document is not already in DocBook or LinuxDoc format, a
	reviewer will convert it for you.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
	After applying the comments from your reviewers, you may send your revised version to the
	submit list for final submission. Again, be sure to include the title
	of the document in the subject line. In the body of your email be sure
	to say that your document has already gone through the review process.
	For more information about your final submission to the LDP, please
	read <xref linkend="submission" />
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

      <tip><title>If you don't submit your document in DocBook format</title><para>
			The volunteer adding markup to your document may choose any 
			accepted markup language. The Author Guide, however,
			will refer only to DocBook. If you are submitting plain text or
			some other format, please let the LDP know if you prefer to
			maintain your document in either LinuxDoc or DocBook, which are the accepted formats for end-results.
      </para></tip>
