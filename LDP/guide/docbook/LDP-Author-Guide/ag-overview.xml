      <title>Summary of The LDP Process</title>
      <para>If you are new to the LDP and want to pick up an
      unmaintained document or write a new one, join the discussion
      mailing list at
      <ulink url="http://lists.tldp.org">http://lists.tldp.org</ulink>.
      This is to make sure the LDP knows who is working on what
      documentation.</para> 
      
	  <para>Once that part is complete, you may write your
      documentation <emphasis>in the format of your
		choice</emphasis> and submit a draft to
      <email>submit@en.tldp.org</email>. The draft will
      be reviewed by an LDP volunteer. In a few short days you will
      get the draft and comments from the volunteer.  After applying
      the comments, you may send this version to the submit list
      again for final submission into the LDP. Review criteria are available
	  in the <ulink url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LDP-Reviewer-HOWTO/">LDP Reviewer 
	  HOWTO</ulink>. You should read the LDP  Reviewer HOWTO
	 yourself before
	  submitting your documentation. (Don't worry, the Reviewer HOWTO pretty short
	  compared to this guide.)</para> 

      <note>
        <para>
          Reviewers:  Please consult the <ulink
		  url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LDP-Reviewer-HOWTO/">LDP Reviewer HOWTO</ulink> for 
		  information about each of the different types of reviews.
        </para>
      </note>

      <para>  <!--please check these changes for correctness!-->
		At this point, if you wrote your document in another format, an LDP volunteer will translate 
      it into some form of markup language.  The markup language format
		that is currently preferred is Docbook XML, see <xref linkend="ag-markup" />. Your reviewer will send the finished document to you.  In this guide, we assume the return format is Docbook XML.  All subsequent revisions of your document to the LDP
		must be in the same format.  If you have markup questions, you may ask the
      volunteer who assisted you, or ask the LDP DocBook list. For
		more information about the LDP DocBook list please read 
		<xref linkend="mailinglists"/>.
	</para>

      <tip><para>
			The volunteer adding markup to your document may choose any 
			accepted markup language. The Author Guide, however,
			will refer only to DocBook. If you are submitting plain text or
			some other format, please let the LDP know if you prefer to
			maintain your document in either LinuxDoc or DocBook, which are the accepted formats for end-results.
      </para></tip>  <!--end of stuff needing check-->

	<para>
		Of course, you can also do the markup to your initial document
		yourself, but remember that it is not required. There are lots of
		templates to get you started in <xref linkend="templates" />.

    <section id="mailinglists">
      <title>Mailing Lists</title>
      <para>You can subscirbe to the following mailing lists:</para>
	  
	  <itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>First is <email>discuss@en.tldp.org</email>, which is the main
      discussion group of the LDP.</para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para>Another is the <email>docbook@en.tldp.org</email> list, which is for
      markup or other questions about the DocBook format itself.  If you run into
      trouble with a particular markup tag, you can send your question
      here for answers.</para></listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	  
	  <para>You can subscribe to either list by sending a request 
	  message to either <email>discuss-subscribe@en.tldp.org</email> or 
	  <email>docbook-subscribe@en.tldp.org</email>.   The subject of your message should read 
      <quote>subscribe</quote> (no quotes). To
      remove yourself from the list, send an E-mail with the subject of
      <quote>unsubscribe</quote> to
	  <email>discuss-unsubscribe@en.tldp.org</email> or
	  <email>docbook-unsubscribe@en.tldp.org</email>.</para>

      <para>
        There is also a mailing list run by <ulink url="http://www.oasis-open.org/">OASIS</ulink> that can 
        answer DocBook questions.  Please see <ulink url="http://docbook.org/mailinglist/index.html">http://docbook.org/mailinglist/index.html</ulink>
        for more information about the mailing lists. We prefer our own list, 
		but only because the LDP list focuses more on tag usage
        than other questions such as formatting.
