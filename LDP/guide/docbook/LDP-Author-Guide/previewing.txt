"DocZilla is a standard Mozilla that contains extra components
providing parsing and displaying SGML/XML documents on the fly without  
a precompilation step.

Additional features on DocZilla are DocZilla GUI (Graphical User
Interface), support for various link types (ID/IDREF and HyTime clinks
with nameloc, treeloc, queryloc locators and XLinks), extended
searching capabilities, document set and table of content-
support. Mozilla as a basis of DocZilla provides support for HTML and
CSS, bookmarks, navigation history, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), etc."
