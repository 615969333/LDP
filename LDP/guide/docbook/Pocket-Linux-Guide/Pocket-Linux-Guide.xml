The Pocket Linux Guide is for anyone interested in learning the techniques of building a GNU/Linux system from source code.  The guide is structured as a project that builds a small diskette-based GNU/Linux system called Pocket Linux.  Each chapter explores a small piece of the overall system explaining how it works, why it is needed and how to build it.  After completing the Pocket Linux project, readers should possess an enhanced knowledge of what makes GNU/Linux systems work as well as the confidence to explore larger, more complex source-code-only projects.
