<title>About Pocket Linux</title>

<para>
The Pocket Linux Guide demonstrates how to build a small console based GNU/Linux system using only source code and a couple of diskettes.  It is intended for Linux users who would like to gain a deeper understanding about how their system works beneath the shroud of distribution specific features and tools.

<title>Prerequisite Skills</title>

<para>
This guide is intended for intermediate to advanced Linux users.  It is not intentionally obscure, but certain assumptions about the readers skill level are made.  Success with this guide depends in part on being able to perform the following tasks:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Use basic shell commands</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Reference man and info pages</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Build a custom Linux kernel</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Compile source code using make and related tools</para></listitem>

<title>Project Format</title>

<para>
The Pocket Linux Guide takes a hands-on approach to learning.  The guide is written with each chapter building a piece of an overall project.  Chapters are further broken into sections of Analysis, Design, Construction and Implementation.  This format is derived from Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodology.  Without going into detail about design methodologies, the sections may be summed up as follows.
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>The Analysis section gives a high-level overview of what is to be accomplished in each chapter.  It will introduce the tasks that need to be completed and why they are important to the overall system.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The Design section defines the source code packages, files and configuration necessary to address the requirements set forth in the Analysis section.  Much of the theory of why certain system files exist and what their purpose is can be found here.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The Construction section is where all the hands on action takes place.  This section goes into detail about building source code and configuring the system files.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The Implementation section will test the proper operation of the project at the end of each chapter.  Often there are a few shell commands to perform and samples of expected screen outputs are given.</para></listitem>
