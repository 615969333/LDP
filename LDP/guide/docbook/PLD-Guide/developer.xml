		Our philosophy I can shorten to one word: cooperative. 
		We are mostly sysadmins, which need stable and
		simultaneously flexible distro - and there is no better way
		to achieve it than do it by ourselves! So we maintain open
		distribution, everyone is encouraged to take a part in
		developing it.
