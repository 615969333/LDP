		<title>Getting CVS Read-Write account</title>
		<para>
			If you have already subscribed to devel e-list, and if
			you have idea how to do something concrete, you can
			ask for CVS Read-Write account. You have to ask
			<ulink url="kloczek@pld.org.pl">Tomasz Kloczko</ulink> 
			- he manages CVS server. But remember, that there is 
			no rules - Tomasz can remove your account without 
			a reason. If you already know some members of PLD-team, 
			you can ask them to recommend you as a new developer 
			- it might be helpful.
