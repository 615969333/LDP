Removing Docs from the In Progress list

Subject: Re: Status of Proposed LDP Document: BLAH HOWTO
Dear Author,

The document you proposed to the LDP in August 2001 entitled
"BLAH" is still on LDP's "In-Progress" list.

Please drop me a line and let me know the status of this work.  If you
still aim to complete it, I'll update my records.  However, if you don't
think you'll have the ability to write/maintain this work, please let me
know so we can remove it from the list.

We'd like to reflect the most accurate list of "In-Progress" documents
available.  Thanks for your understanding; I look forward to hearing
from you.

Sincerely,
