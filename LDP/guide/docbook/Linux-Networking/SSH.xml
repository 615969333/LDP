<para>
The Secure Shell, or SSH, provides a way of running command line and
graphical applications, and transferring files, over an encrypted
connection. SSH uses up to 2,048-bit encryption with a variety of
cryptographic schemes to make sure that if a cracker intercepts your
connection, all they can see is useless gibberish. It is both a
protocol and a suite of small command line applications which can be
used for various functions.

<para>
SSH replaces the old Telnet application, and can be used for secure
remote administration of machines across the Internet. However, it
has more features.

<para>
SSH increases the ease of running applications remotely by setting up
permissions automatically. If you can log into a machine, it allows you
to run a graphical application on it, unlike Telnet, which requires users
to type lots of geeky xhost and xauth commands. SSH also has inbuild
compression, which allows your graphic applications to run much faster
over the network.

<para>
SCP (Secure Copy) and SFTP (Secure FTP) allow transfer of files over the
remote link, either via SSH's own command line utilities or graphical tools
like Gnome's GFTP. Like Telnet, SSH is cross-platform. You can find SSH
servers and clients for Linux, Unix, all flavours of Windows, BeOS, PalmOS,
Java and Embedded OSes used in routers.

<para>
Encrypted remote shell sessions are available through SSH

allowing secure remote administration.
