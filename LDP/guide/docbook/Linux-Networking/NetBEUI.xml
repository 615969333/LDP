<para>
NetBEUI (NetBIOS Extended User Interface) is a transport-layer protocol
developed by Microsoft and IBM. NetBEUI was mainly intended as a basic
protocol to support NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System), the
Windows standard for workstation naming, communications, and file sharing.

<para>
NetBEUI is a fast protocol with a low overhead, which makes it a good
choice for small networks. However, it is a non-routable protocol.
Networks that use NetBEUI can be use bridges for traffic management,
but cannot use routers. Another disadvantage is its proprietary nature.
NetBEUI is supported by few systems other than Windows.

<para>
Although NetBEUI was developed by Microsoft and was the default protocol
for some operating systems (such as Windows for Workgroups and Windows 95),
Microsoft recommends TCP/IP over NetBEUI for most Windows NT networks.
