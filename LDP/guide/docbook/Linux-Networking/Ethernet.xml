Ethernet

Ethernet is the most common network architecture worldwide. It was developed by Xerox,
Intel and DEC in the late 1960s and revised as Ethernet 2.0 in 1982. Ethernet networks
the CSMA/CD (carrier sense multiple access with collision detection) media access method,
defined in IEEE 802.3.

There are three Ethernet standards for different media:

See P41 of Oreilly "MSCE Networking"

10BaseT
10Base2
10Base5

Fast Ethernet

Fast Ethernet, also known as 100BaseT, is a new standard for 100 Mbps Ethernet. Fast Ethernet
can use two-pair Category 5 cable of four-pair Category 3-5 cable.

100BaseT uses a physical star topology identical to that used by 10BaseT, but requires that
all equipment (hubs, NICs, and repeaters) support 100 Mbps speeds. Some NICs and hubs can support
both standards, but all devices on the network need to be configured to use the same standard.

Several manufacturers devleloped 100 Mbps Ethernet devices before 100BaseT became a standard. The
most popular of these, 100VG-AnyLan, is still widely used. This standard uses a demand priority
access method rather than CSMA/CD, and also supports networks that combine Ethernet and Token
Ring packets.

GigE

GigE Ethernet, also known as 1000BaseT or Gigabit Ethernet. GigE can only use Cat 5 cable.

GigE uses the same topology as that of Fast Ethernet (ie. physical star topology). Like Fast Ethernet
though it requires that hubs/switches on the LAN to be GigE capable. If not it will revert back to
100BaseT, and if this is not available to 10BaseT Ethernet.
