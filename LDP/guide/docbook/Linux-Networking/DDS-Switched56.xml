<title>DDS-Switched56</title>

<para>	
DDS (Digital Data Service) and Switched 56 are types types of dedicated
digital line provided by phone carriers. DDS lines are more
expensive than dedicated analog lines, but support a more consistent quality.
DDS lines support a speed of 56 Kbps. A device called a CSU/DSU (Channel
Service Unit/Digital Service Unit) is used to connect the network to the
dedicated line.

<para>
Switched 56 is an alternative to DDS that privdies the same type of
connection, but in a circuit-switched format. The line is available
on demand rather than continuously, and you are billed for the hours that
you use it. ISDN has largely replaced Switched 56 for this purpose.
