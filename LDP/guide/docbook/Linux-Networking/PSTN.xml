PSTN (Public Service Telephone Network)

The telephone system that is used thoughout the U.S. and many other countries. Although never
intended for networking, telephone lines can be used for communications for computers.

A modem (modulator/demodulator) is used to interface between a computer and the telephone system.
Modems can convert data into audible tones and back. The fastest two-way modems currently available
support a speed of 22.6 Kbps (kilobits per second). 

Current modems advertise speeds up to 56 Kbps per second. These modems rely on digital equipment being
used in the phone company's central office and in the facility (such as the Internet Service Provider)
you are dialling into. The 56 Kbps speed also works in only one direction; the other direction supports
33.6 Kbps.
