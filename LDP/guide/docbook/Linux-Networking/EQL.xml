EQL is integrated into the Linux kernel. If two serial connections
exist to some other computer (this usually requires two modems and two
telephone lines) and  SLIP or PPP (protocols for sending Internet
traffic over telephone lines) are used on them, it is possible to make
them behave like one double speed connection using this driver.
Naturally, this has to be supported at the other end as well.
