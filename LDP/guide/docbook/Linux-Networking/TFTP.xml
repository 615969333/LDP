Setting up TFTP is almost as easy as DHCP.

First install from the rpm package:
# rpm -ihv tftp-server-*.rpm                                                 
                                                                             

Create a directory for the files:
# mkdir /tftpboot                                                            
# chown nobody:nobody /tftpboot                                              
                                                                             

The directory /tftpboot is owned by user nobody, because this is the default
user id set up by tftpd to access the files.

Edit the file /etc/xinetd.d/tftp to look like the following:
service tftp                                                                 
{                                                                            
        socket_type     = dgram                                              
        protocol        = udp                                                
        wait            = yes                                                
        user            = root                                               
        server          = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd                                 
        server_args     = -c -s /tftpboot                                    
        disable         = no                                                 
        per_source      = 11                                                 
        cps             = 100 2                                              
}                                                                            
                                                                             

The changes from the default file are the parameter disable = no (to enable
the service) and the server argument -c. This argument allows for the
creation of files, which is necessary if you want to save boot or disk
images. You may want to make TFTP read only in normal operation.

Then reload xinetd:

/etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd reload

You can use the tftp command, available from the tftp (client) rpm package,
to test the server. At the tftp prompt, you can issue the commands put and 
get.
