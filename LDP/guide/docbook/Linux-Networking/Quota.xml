<title>Quota</title>

<para>
This section describes how to enable file system quota on a Linux
host, assigning quota for users and groups, as well as the usage of
miscellaneous quota commands. It is intended for users running kernel
2.x (recently tested on kernel 2.4.21).
</para>

1.  What is quota?

1.1.  What is quota for?

<para>
Quota allows you to specify limits on two aspects of disk storage: the
number of inodes a user or a group of users may possess; and the
number of disk blocks that may be allocated to a user or a group of
users.
</para>

<para>
The idea behind quota is that users are forced to stay under their
disk consumption limit, taking away their ability to consume unlimited
disk space on a system. Quota is handled on a per user, per file
system basis. If there is more than one file system which a user is
expected to create files, then quota must be set for each file system
separately. Various tools are available for you to administer and
automate quota policies on your system.
</para>

1.2.  Current Status of Quota on Linux

<para>
Currently, there are some major changes in the way quota works. There
are two different setups. The tools works the same, but there's a
difference in used files. This document describes the setup and
operation of the _new_ quota setup. As the new setup of quota is not
in the regular kernel source, this setup needs some patching. We will
describe this patching and installation of the linuxquota package. If
you already have the quota software installed on your system, you may
or may not have to install this patch and package. You can email me if
you have any questions about this. I'll try to include a overview of
Linux distro's and it's implications in a later version of this
document.
</para>

2.  Requirements for quota

2.1.  Kernel

<para>
The 2.x kernel source is available from http://www.kernel.org
<http://www.kernel.org/> Please use an available mirror close to your
location to save bandwidth. If you have a recent version of tar, you
can download the .bz2 compressed file.
</para>

<para>
Untar the kernel:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
______________________________________________________________________
cd /usr/src
tar jxvf /path/to/linux-2.4.21-tar.bz2      - for bzip2 kernel -
tar zxvf /path/to/linux-2.4.21-tar.gz       - for gzip kernel -
ln -s /usr/src/linux-2.4.21 /usr/src/linux
______________________________________________________________________
</screen>
</para>

2.2.  Quota software

<para>
Depending on the Linux distribution you have, you may, or may not have
the quota softwares installed on your system. The most recent version
of quota is available through SourceForge and is in active
development. You can reach the homepage of the quota-development at
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/linuxquota
<http://www.sourceforge.net/project/linuxquota>.
</para>

3.  Quota setup: installation and configuration

3.1.  Patch the kernel

<para>
Download the patch for your kernel at:
</para>

<para>
ftp::/atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/pub/local/jack/quota/
<ftp://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/pub/local/jack/quota/>.
</para>

<para>
Choose your kernel version and download the patch(es). Patch your
kernel with the 'patch' command. If there is more than 1 patch for
your kernel version, be sure to apply the patches in the correct
order.
</para>

<para>
You can use this script ( I assume the downloaded patches are in
/tmp/quota/ and the kernel has been untarred to /usr/src/linux) :
</para>

<para>
<screen>
______________________________________________________________________
#!/bin/sh

gunzip /tmp/quota/*.gz
cd /usr/src/linux
COUNT=`ls -1 /tmp/quota/*.diff | wc -l`
for I in `seq 1 $COUNT`
do
   patch -p1 < /tmp/quota/quota-2.4.21-$I-*.diff
done
______________________________________________________________________
</screen>
</para>

3.2.  Reconfigure your kernel

<para>
Reconfigure your kernel and add quota support.
</para>

<para>
Via `make menuconfig` or `make xconfig` you can find the option to
support quota under the Filesystems-menu. You can specify extra
options if you need them, like 32-bit UID support.
</para>

<para>
Save the configuration and compile the kernel.  Make sure the new
kernel will be used when rebooting the system.
</para>

3.3.  Compile and install the quota softwares

<para>
To be able to use all the features of the new quota system, you'll
probably need to download the new quota-package. Download the new
quota software via the URL provided above.
</para>

<para>
When downloaded do:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
______________________________________________________________________
$ gzip -dc <downloaded file> | tar xvf
$ cd quota-tools  (or whatever directory the software is put in)
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su
# make install
______________________________________________________________________
</screen>
</para>

<para>
3.4.  time Modify your system init script to check quota and turn
quota on at boot
</para>

<para>
Here's an example:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
______________________________________________________________________
# Check quota and then turn quota on.
if [ -x /usr/sbin/quotacheck ]
        then
               echo "Checking quotas. This may take some time."
               /usr/sbin/quotacheck -avug
               echo " Done."
        fi
         if [ -x /usr/sbin/quotaon ]
        then
                echo "Turning on quota."
                /usr/sbin/quotaon -avug
        fi
______________________________________________________________________
</screen>
</para>

<para>
The golden rule is that always turn quota on after your file systems
in /etc/fstab have been mounted, otherwise quota will fail to work. I
recommend turning quota on right after the part where file systems are
mounted in your system init script.
</para>

3.5.  Modify /etc/fstab

<para>
Partitions that you have not yet enabled quota normally look something
like:
</para>


<para>
<screen>
______________________________________________________________________
/dev/hda1       /       ext2    defaults        1       1
/dev/hda2       /usr    ext2    defaults        1       1
______________________________________________________________________
</screen>
</para>

<para>
To enable user quota support on a file system, add "usrquota" to the
fourth field containing the word "defaults" (man fstab for details).
</para>

<para>
<screen>
______________________________________________________________________
/dev/hda1       /       ext2    defaults        1       1
/dev/hda2       /usr    ext2    defaults,usrquota       1       1
______________________________________________________________________
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Replace "usrquota" with "grpquota", should you need group quota
support on a file system.
</para>

<para>
<screen>
______________________________________________________________________
/dev/hda1       /       ext2    defaults        1       1
/dev/hda2       /usr    ext2    defaults,grpquota       1       1
______________________________________________________________________
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Need both user quota and group quota support on a file system?
</para>

<para>
<screen>
______________________________________________________________________
/dev/hda1       /       ext2    defaults        1       1
/dev/hda2       /usr    ext2    defaults,usrquota,grpquota       1   1
______________________________________________________________________
</screen>
</para>

3.6.  Activate the quota system

<para>
To activate the quota software you have to reboot the system for the
changes you have made to take effect. The new kernel with quota
support will be loaded and the startup scripts you've just created
will be executed. At first run, quotacheck will generate the
appropiate files to maintain the quota databases.
</para>

3.7.  Add quotacheck to crontab

<para>
Although quota should work with periodical checks, it sometimes helps
to run quotacheck periodically, e.g. weekly. Add the following line to
your root's crontab:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
______________________________________________________________________
0 3 * * 0 /sbin/quotacheck -avug
______________________________________________________________________
</screen>
</para>

4.  Quota setup: tools

<para>
This operation is performed with the edquota command (`man edquota`
for details).
</para>

4.1.  Assigning quota for a particular user

<para>
Here's an example. I have a user with the login id bob on my system.
The command "edquota -u bob" takes me into vi (or editor specified in
my $EDITOR environment variable) to edit quota for user bob on each
partition that has quota enabled:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
______________________________________________________________________
Quotas for user bob:
/dev/hda3: blocks in use: 2594, limits (soft = 5000, hard = 6500)
         inodes in use: 356, limits (soft = 1000, hard = 1500)
______________________________________________________________________
</screen>
</para>

<para>
"blocks in use" is the total number of blocks (in kilobytes) a user
has consumed on a partition.
</para>

<para>
"inodes in use" is the total number of inodes a user has consumed on a
partition.
</para>

4.2.  Assigning quota for a particular group

<para>
Now I have a group games on my system. "edquota -g games" takes me
into the vi editor again to edit quota for the group games:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
______________________________________________________________________
        Quotas for group games:
        /dev/hda4: blocks in use: 5799, limits (soft = 8000, hard = 10000)
                inodes in use: 1454, limits (soft = 3000, hard = 4000)
______________________________________________________________________
</screen>
</para>

4.3.  Assigning quota for a bunch of users with the same value

<para>
To rapidly set quotas for, say 100 users, on my system to the same
value as my user bob, I would first edit bob's quota information by
hand, then execute:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
______________________________________________________________________
edquota -p bob `awk -F: '$3 > 499 {print $1}' /etc/passwd`
______________________________________________________________________
</screen>
</para>

<para>
assuming that you are using csh, and that you assign your user UID's
starting with 500.
</para>

<para>
In addition to edquota, there are 3 terms which you should familiarize
yourself with: Soft Limit, Hard Limit, and Grace Period.
</para>

4.4.  Soft Limit

<para>
_Soft limit_ indicates the maximum amount of disk usage a quota user
has on a partition. When combined with grace period, it acts as the
border line, which a quota user is issued warnings about his impending
quota violation when passed.
</para>

4.5.  Hard Limit

<para>
Hard limit works only when grace period is set. It specifies the
absolute limit on the disk usage, which a quota user can't go beyond
his hard limit.
</para>

4.6.  Grace Period

<para>
Executed with the command "edquota -t", grace period is a time limit
before the soft limit is enforced for a file system with quota
enabled. Time units of sec(onds), min(utes), hour(s), day(s), week(s),
and month(s) can be used.  This is what you'll see with the command
"edquota -t":
</para>

<para>
<screen>
______________________________________________________________________
Time units may be: days, hours, minutes, or seconds
Grace period before enforcing soft limits for users:
/dev/hda2: block grace period: 0 days, file grace period: 0 days
______________________________________________________________________
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Change the 0 days part to any length of time you feel reasonable. I
personally would choose 7 days (or 1 week).
</para>

5.  Miscellaneous Quota Commands

5.1.  Quotacheck

<para>
Quotacheck is used to scan a file system for disk usages, and updates
the quota record file "aquota.user" to the most recent state. I
recommend running quotacheck at system bootup, and via cronjob
periodically (say, every week?).
</para>

5.2.  Repquota

<para>
Repquota produces a summarized quota information for a file system.
Here is a sample output repquota gives:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
______________________________________________________________________
# repquota -a
                                Block limits               File limits
        User            used    soft    hard  grace    used  soft  hard  grace
        root      --  175419       0       0          14679     0     0
        bin       --   18000       0       0            735     0     0
        uucp      --     729       0       0             23     0     0
        man       --      57       0       0             10     0     0
        user1     --   13046   15360   19200            806  1500  2250
        user2     --    2838    5120    6400            377  1000  1500
______________________________________________________________________
</screen>
</para>

5.3.  Quotaon and Quotaoff

<para>
Quotaon is used to turn on quota accounting; quotaoff to turn it off.
Actually both files are similar. They are executed at system startup
and shutdown.
</para>
