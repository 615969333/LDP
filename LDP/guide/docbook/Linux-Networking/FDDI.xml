<para>
FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface) is a high-speed, reliable, long-distance
networking scheme often used for network backbones and networks that require
high bandwidth. FDDI uses fiber optic cable wired in a true ring. It supports
speeds up to 100 Mbps and a maximum distance bewteen nodes of 100 kilometers
(62 miles).
</para>

<para>
FDDI uses token-passing scheme wired into two rings, primary and secondary. The
primary ring is used for normal networking. When a failure is detected, the
secondary ring is used in the opposite direction to compensate for the failure
in the primary ring.
</para>

<para>
The advantages of FDDI are their high speed, long distance, and reliablity.
The token-passing scheme used by FDDI is also more sophisticated than that
of Token Ring: it allows multiple packets to be on the ring at once, and
allows certain nodes to be given higher priority than the rest. The
disadvantage of FDDI is its high cost and the difficult in installing and
maintaing fiber optic cable.

<para>
FDDI device names are `fddi0', `fddi1', `fddi2' etc. The first card
detected by the kernel is assigned `fddi0' and the rest are assigned
sequentially in the order they are detected.

  Kernel Compile Options:

          Network device support  --->
              [*] FDDI driver support
              [*] Digital DEFEA and DEFPA adapter support

</para>      

<para>
When you have your kernel built to support the FDDI driver and
installed, configuration of the FDDI interface is almost identical to
that of an ethernet interface. You just specify the appropriate FDDI
interface name in the ifconfig and route commands.
