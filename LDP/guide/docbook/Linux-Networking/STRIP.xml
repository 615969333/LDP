  STRIP is a protocol designed specifically for a range of Metricom
  radio modems for a research project being conducted by Stanford
  University called the MosquitoNet Project.  There is a lot of
  interesting reading here, even if you aren't directly interested in
  the project.

  The Metricom radios connect to a serial port, employ spread spectrum
  technology and are typically capable of about 100kbps.  Information on
  the Metricom radios is available from the: Metricom Web Server.

  At present the standard network tools and utilities do not support the
  STRIP driver, so you will have to download some customized tools from
  the MosquitoNet web server. Details on what software you need is
  available at the: MosquitoNet STRIP Page.

  A summary of configuration is that you use a modified slattach program
  to set the line discipline of a serial tty device to STRIP and then
  configure the resulting `st[0-9]' device as you would for ethernet
  with one important exception, for technical reasons STRIP does not
  support the ARP protocol, so you must manually configure the ARP
  entries for each of the hosts on your subnet. This shouldn't prove too
  onerous.
