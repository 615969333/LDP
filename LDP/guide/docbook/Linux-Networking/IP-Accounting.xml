  8.4.  IP Accounting

  This option of the Linux kernel keeps track of IP network traffic,
  performs packet logging and produces some statistics. A series of
  rules may be defined so when a packet matches a given pattern, some
  action is performed: a counter is increased, it is accepted/rejected,
  etc.
