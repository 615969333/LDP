  8.6.  Traffic Shaping

  The traffic shaper is a virtual network device that makes it possible
  to limit the rate of outgoing data flow over another network device.
  This is especially useful in scenarios such as ISPs, where it is
  desirable to control and enforce policies regarding how much bandwidth
  is used by each client. Another alternative (for web services only)
  may be certain Apache modules which restrict the number of IP
  connections by client or the bandwidth used.

Traffic control encompasses the sets of mechanisms and operations by which
packets are queued for transmission/reception on a network interface. The
operations include enqueuing, policing, classifying, scheduling, shaping and
dropping. This HOWTO provides an introduction and overview of the
capabilities and implementation of traffic control under Linux.
