Created in the early 1970s, Telnet provides a method of running command
line applications on a remote computer as if that person were actually at
the remote site. Telnet is one of the most powerful tools for Unix, allowing
for true remote administration. It is also an interesting program from the
point of view of users, because it allows remote access to all their files
and programs from anywhere in the Internet. Combined with an X server (as
well as some rather arcane manipluation of authentication 'cookies' and
'DISPLAY' environment variables), there is no difference (apart from the
delay) between being at the console or on the other side of the planet.
However, since the 'telnet' protocol sends data 'en-clair' and there are
now more efficient protocols with features such as built-in
compression and 'tunneling' which allows for greater ease of usage of graphical
applications across the network as well as more secure connections it is an
effectively a dead protocol. Like the 'r' (such as rlogin and rsh) related
protocols it is still used though, within internal networks for the reasons
of ease of installation and use as well as backwards compatibility and also
as a means by which to configure networking devices such as routers
and firewalls.
