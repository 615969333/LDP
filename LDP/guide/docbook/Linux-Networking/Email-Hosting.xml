Alongside the Web, mail is the top reason for the popularity of the Internet. Email is an inexpensive and fast method of time-shifted messaging which, much like the Web, is actually based around sending and receiving plain text files. The protocol used is called the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). The server programs that implement SMTP to move mail from one server to another are called Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs).

In times gone by, users would Telnet into the SMTP server itself and use a command line program like elm or pine to check ther mail. These days, users run email clients like Netscape, Evolution, Kmail or Outlook on their desktop to check their email off a local SMTP server. Additional protocols like POP3 and IMAP4 are used between the SMTP server and desktop mail client to allow clients to manipulate files on, and download from, their local mail server. The programs that implement POP3 and IMAP4 are called Mail Delivery Agents (MDAs). They are generally separate from MTAs.
