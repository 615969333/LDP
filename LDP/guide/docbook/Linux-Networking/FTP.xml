File Transport Protocol (FTP) is an efficient way to transfer files between
machines across networks and clients and servers exist for almost all platforms
making FTP the most convenient (and therefore popular) method of transferring
files. FTP was first developed by the University of California, Berkeley for
inclusion in 4.2BSD (Berkeley Unix). The RFC (Request for Comments)
documents for the protocol is now known as RFC 959 and is available at
ftp://nic.merit.edu/documents/rfc/rfc0959.txt.

There are two typical modes of running an FTP server - either anonymously or
account-based. Anonymous FTP servers are by far the most popular; they allow
any machine to access the FTP server and the files stored on it with the same
permissions. No usernames or passwords are transmitted down the wire.
Account-based FTP allows users to login with real usernames and passwords.
While it provides greater access control than anonymous FTP, transmitting real
usernames and password unencrypted over the Internet is generally avoided for
security reasons.

An FTP client is the userland application that provides access to FTP
servers. There are many FTP clients available. Some are graphical, and
some are text-based.
