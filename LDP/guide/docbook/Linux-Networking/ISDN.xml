ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network)

Originally developed as a digital alternative to the standard PSTN telephone system for voice
communications. It was introduced in 1984, but is only now being widely implemented in the U.S.
There are two available ISDN packages:

- BRI (Basic Rate Interface) include two B channels (64 Kbps apiece) for voice or data transmissions,
and a D channel (16 Kbps) for call control. This is the ordinary consumer ISN service.

- PRI (Primary Rate Interface) is a more expensive alternative that includes 23 B channels and one D channel.
This is the equivalent of a T1 line, explained below.

ISDN's B channels are typically used for packet-switched data transmission, and the D channel is typically
used for call control and switching; however, the D channel can also be used for data transmission in
low-bandwidth applications.

  3.6.  ISDN

  The Linux kernel has built-in ISDN capabilies. Isdn4linux controls
  ISDN PC cards and can emulate a modem with the Hayes command set ("AT"
  commands). The possibilities range from simply using a terminal
  program to connections via HDLC (using included devices) to full
  connection to the Internet with PPP to audio applications.
