<title>IRC</title>

<para>
This document aims to describe the basics of IRC and respective applications
for Linux.

1. Introduction

This document is still WIP, and should be treated as such. I'll do my best to
keep it updated and accurate.

The following bibles shouldn't be ignored:

  * RFC1459 by Jarkko Oikarinen and Darren Reed was the first about the
    Internet Relay Chat Protocol. It can be found at [http://ftp.isi.edu/
    in-notes/rfc1459.txt] http://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1459.txt.
   
  * RFC2810 by Christophe Kalt updates RFC1459 and describes the Architecture
    of the Internet Relay Chat. It can be found at [http://ftp.isi.edu/
    in-notes/rfc2810.txt] http://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2810.txt.
   
  * RFC2811 by Christophe Kalt updates RFC1459 and describes the Channel
    Management of the Internet Relay Chat. It can be found at [http://
    ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2811.txt] http://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/
    rfc2811.txt.
   
  * RFC2812 by Christophe Kalt updates RFC1459 and describes the Client
    Protocol of the Internet Relay Chat. It can be found at [http://
    ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2812.txt] http://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/
    rfc2812.txt.
   
  * RFC2813 by Christophe Kalt updates RFC1459 and describes the Server
    Protocol of the Internet Relay Chat. It can be found at [http://
    ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2813.txt] http://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/
    rfc2813.txt.

1.1. Objectives

Among others, the objectives of this mini-HOWTO are:

  * Link important resources about IRC;
   
  * Avoid common misuses of IRC by writing an IRC Etiquette;
   
  * List popular clients, servers, bots, and bouncers, along with their
    maintainers, #channel, small description, download location, home page,
    and hints;
   
  * List IRC tools available in the latest release of all major
    distributions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. About IRC

Excerpt from RFC2810:

The IRC (Internet Relay Chat) protocol is for use with text based
conferencing. It has been developed since 1989 when it was originally
implemented as a mean for users on a BBS to chat amongst themselves.

First formally documented in May 1993 by RFC 1459 [IRC], the protocol has
kept evolving.

The IRC Protocol is based on the client-server model, and is well suited to
running on many machines in a distributed fashion. A typical setup involves a
single process (the server) forming a central point for clients (or other
servers) to connect to, performing the required message delivery/multiplexing
and other functions.

This distributed model, which requires each server to have a copy of the
global state information, is still the most flagrant problem of the protocol
as it is a serious handicap, which limits the maximum size a network can
reach. If the existing networks have been able keep growing at an incredible
pace, we must thank hardware manufacturers for giving us ever more powerful
systems.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Beginner's guide on using IRC

The standard IRC client is the original ircII client. It's part of most Linux
distributions.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1. Running the ircII program

It's easy to use ircII. Let's say you want to connect to irc.freenode.net as
mini-HOWTO.

At the command line, type:

$ irc mini-HOWTO irc.freenode.net

You can also export variables, so you won't need to use them at the command
line:

$ export IRCNICK=mini-HOWTO IRCSERVER=irc.freenode.net

Add them to your shell profile (e.g. ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zprofile) when
you're done.

Other common variables are IRCNAME and IRCUSER, to respectively set the
ircname part of a /whois and username as seen at the first line 'mini-HOWTO
is ~username@hostname (ircname)'. Keep in mind that IRCUSER won't work if you
run an ident daemon (default on most distributions). If you still need to
change your username (not recommended, and I hope you're not using IRC logged
as root !), install oidentd from [http://ojnk.sourceforge.net/] http://
ojnk.sourceforge.net/. To configure, read the oidentd.conf man page. Finally
run '/usr/local/sbin/oidentd -g nobody -u nobody'. Add this to your startup
scripts (e.g. /etc/rc.d/rc.local) when you're done.

If not set, IRCNICK, IRCUSER, and IRCNAME will be retrieved from /etc/passwd
.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2. Commands

Use /help to get a list on all available commands (/help help is a good
start). Replace nick by any IRCNICK.

  * First, /set NOVICE off
   
  * /nick IRC-mini-HOWTO changes your IRCNICK to IRC-mini-HOWTO
   
  * /set realname The Linux IRC mini-HOWTO changes your IRCNAME to The Linux
    IRC mini-HOWTO (doesn't change on the same connection)
   
  * /j #mini-HOWTO joins channel #mini-HOWTO
   
  * /j #unmaintained-HOWTO joins channel #unmaintained-HOWTO
   
  * /j #mini-HOWTO changes the active current channel to #mini-HOWTO
   
  * /msg nick Hi. sends a private message to nick containing Hi.
   
  * /notice nick (or #mini-HOWTO) Hi. sends a notice to nick (or #mini-HOWTO)
    containing Hi.
   
  * /query nick starts a private conversation with nick. /query ends the
    private conversation
   
  * /me loves Linux. sends an action to the current channel or query
    containing IRC-mini-HOWTO loves Linux.
   
  * /dcc chat nick starts a chat with nick. Use /msg =nick (notice the =) to
    send messages over the chat
   
  * /dcc send nick /etc/HOSTNAME sends the given file to nick
   
  * /dcc get nick receives the file offered by nick
   
  * /part leaves the active current channel
   
  * /part #unmaintained-HOWTO leaves channel #unmaintained-HOWTO
   
  * /discon disconnects from current IRCSERVER
   
  * /server irc.us.freenet.net connects to IRCSERVER irc.us.freenet.net
   
  * /quit Bye. quits your IRC session with a reason Bye.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3. IRC Etiquette

WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING

  * Never use IRC logged as root or any user with excessive privileges. Bad
    things may happen sooner or later. You were warned. It's safe if you
    create 2 users, one of them to only use IRC.
   

$ man adduser

On Linux channels you shouldn't:

  * Act as an idiot. If you want to be respected, then first respect each
    other.
   
  * Use colors (^C). Most Linux users don't tolerate such mIRC crazes, and
    ircII doesn't really support them. The same should apply for ANSI.
   
  * Use full CAPS, bold (^B), reverse (^V), underline (^_), blink (^F), and
    bell (^G). The first 4 are here to emphasize words, not the whole text.
    The last 2 are just very annoying.
   
  * Ask if you can ask a question. Just ask, but first read all documentation
    available on the subject. Start looking at [file:/usr/doc/] /usr/doc/ ,
    otherwise go to [http://www.tldp.org/] http://www.tldp.org/ or [http://
    www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/] http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/.
    And don't repeat your question immediately. Wait at least 10 minutes. If
    you don't get any answer it's because nobody knows or wants to help.
    Respect their choice, they're not your personal assistant. Also never
    send mass private messages. It's like SPAM.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Console IRC Clients

4.1. ircII

Maintainer: ircII project (<ircii @ eterna.com.au>)

IRC Channel: #ircII (official channel ?) on [http://www.efnet.org/
servers.html] EFNet

Originally written by Michael Sandrof, ircII comes with most Linux
distributions. It uses termcap and shouldn't be a choice for most users, but
is a standard. Mathusalem and other gurus will use it. Less ventured will
regret to have it installed.

You can get the latest version of ircII from [ftp://ircftp.au.eterna.com.au/
pub/ircII/] ftp://ircftp.au.eterna.com.au/pub/ircII/. Homepage at [http://
www.eterna.com.au/ircii/] http://www.eterna.com.au/ircii/.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2. EPIC

Maintainer: EPIC Software Labs (<ircii-epic @ concentric.net>)

IRC Channel: #EPIC on EFNet

Based on ircII, EPIC (Enhanced Programmable ircII Client) is meant for real
scripters and users searching freedom. When you start it for the first time
you'll notice that you should really learn the basics of scripting.

You can get the latest version of EPIC from [ftp://ftp.epicsol.org/pub/epic/]
ftp://ftp.epicsol.org/pub/epic/. Homepage at [http://www.epicsol.org/] http:/

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.3. BitchX

Maintainer: Colten Edwards (<edwards @ bitchx.dimension6.com>)

IRC Channel: #BitchX on EFNet

Based on ircII and EPIC, BitchX could be compared to the Pine MUA. Bloatware
(doesn't mean you shouldn't use it) and widely used. The choice for users
that want a client with built-in facilities. It can be compiled with the
GNOME libraries by using the configure option --with-gtk. Don't be surprised
if all you get is a XTerm-BitchX instead.

You can get the latest version of BitchX from [ftp://ftp.bitchx.org/pub/

toolkit. The army called on him, and the new maintainers wouldn't do the job.
yagIRC passed away and he started irssi as a replacement. It used GTK+. GNOME
and curses versions would appear later. As of 0.7.90 it's only a modular text
mode client. Supports Perl scripting.

9. Installation

9.1. Clients

All popular clients use GNU autoconf and GNU automake, thus come with a
configure script. Read the installation instructions after you unpack the
sources. Be sure you have the required libraries in order to compile. Doing
cd sources; mkdir objdir; cd objdir; ../configure --help; ../configure 
your_options_here; make; make install (or make install_strip) > ~/
sources_install.log is the right procedure. Also note that for ircII, EPIC,
and BitchX you should really edit include/config.h to suit your needs.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.2. Servers

Do you really need help to set up a server ?

~$ vim ircd.conf
