<title>Load-Balancing</title>

<para>
Demand for load balancing usually arises in database/web access when
many clients make simultaneous requests to a server. It would be
desirable to have multiple identical servers and redirect requests to
the less loaded server. This can be achieved through Network Address
Translation techniques (NAT) of which IP masquerading is a subset.
Network administrators can replace a single server providing Web
services - or any other application - with a logical pool of servers
sharing a common IP address. Incoming connections are directed to a
particular server using one load-balancing algorithm. The virtual
server rewrites incoming and outgoing packets to give clients the
appearance that only one server exists.
