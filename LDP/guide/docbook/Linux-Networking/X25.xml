  8.14.  X.25

  X.25 is a circuit based packet switching protocol defined by the
  C.C.I.T.T. (a standards body recognized by Telecommunications
  companies in most parts of the world). An implementation of X.25 and
  LAPB are being worked on and recent 2.1.* kernels include the work in
  progress.

  Jonathon Naylor jsn@cs.nott.ac.uk is leading the development and a
  mailing list has been established to discuss Linux X.25 related
  matters.  To subscribe send a message to: majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu
  with the text "subscribe linux-x25" in the body of the message.

  Early versions of the configuration tools may be obtained from
  Jonathon's ftp site at ftp.cs.nott.ac.uk.

X.25

A protocol developed in the 1970s for packet swithching, allowing customers to share access
to a PDN (Public Data Network). These networks, such as Sprintnet and Tymnet, were the most
practical way to connect large companies at the time, and are still used by some companies.
PDNs are networks that have local dial-up access points in cities throughout the countrym and
use dedicated lines to network between these cities. Companies would dial up in two locations
to connect their computers.

Computers, routers, or other devices that access a PDN using the X.225 protocols are called
data terminal equipment, or DTEs. DTEs without built-in support for X.25 is a protocol with a
relatively high overhead, since it provides error control and accouting for users of the network.

The X.25 protocol supports speeds up to 64 Kbps. This makes it impractical for many networks, but
it is an inexpensive alternative for low-bandwidth applications. X,25 is a protocol with a relatively
high overhead, since it provides error control and accouting for users of the network.
