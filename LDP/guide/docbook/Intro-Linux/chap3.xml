<title>About files and the file system</title>
<abstract>
<para>After the initial exploration in <xref linkend="chap_02" />, we are ready to discuss the files and directories on a Linux system in more detail.  Many users have difficulties with Linux because they lack an overview of what kind of data is kept in which locations.  We will try to shine some light on the organization of files in the file system.
</para>
<para>We will also list the most important files and directories and use different methods of viewing the content of those files, and learn how files and directories can be created, moved and deleted.</para>
<para>After completion of the exercises in this chapter, you will be able to:</para>

<sect2 id="sect_03_01_01"><title>Files</title>
<sect3 id="sect_03_01_01_01"><title>General</title>
<para>A simple description of the UNIX system, also applicable to Linux, is this:</para>
<para><quote>On a UNIX system, everything is a file; if something is not a file, it is a process.</quote></para>
<para>This statement is true because there are special files that are more than just files (named pipes and sockets, for instance), but to keep things simple, saying that everything is a file is an acceptable generalization.  A Linux system, just like UNIX, makes no difference between a file and a directory, since a directory is just a file containing names of other files.  Programs, services, texts, images, and so forth, are all files.  Input and output devices, and generally all devices, are considered to be files, according to the system.</para>
<para>In order to manage all those files in an orderly fashion, man likes to think of them in an ordered tree-like structure on the hard disk, as we know from MS-DOS (Disk Operating System) for instance.  The large branches contain more branches, and the branches at the end contain the tree's leaves or normal files.  For now we will use this image of the tree, but we will find out later why this is not a fully accurate image.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_03_01_01_02"><title>Sorts of files</title>
<para>Most files are just files, called <emphasis>regular</emphasis> files; they contain normal data, for example text files, executable files or programs, input for or output from a program and so on.</para>
<para>While it is reasonably safe to suppose that everything you encounter on a Linux system is a file, there are some exceptions.</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Directories</emphasis>: files that are lists of other files.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Special files</emphasis>: the mechanism used for input and output.  Most special files are in <filename>/dev</filename>, we will discuss them later.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Links</emphasis>: a system to make a file or directory visible in multiple parts of the system's file tree.  We will talk about links in detail.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>(Domain) sockets</emphasis>: a special file type, similar to TCP/IP sockets, providing inter-process networking protected by the file system's access control.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Named pipes</emphasis>: act more or less like sockets and form a way for processes to communicate with each other, without using network socket semantics.</para></listitem>

<para>
Before we look at the important files and directories, we need to know more about partitions.</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_03_01_02"><title>About partitioning</title>
<sect3 id="sect_03_01_02_01"><title>Why partition?</title>
<para>Most people have a vague knowledge of what partitions are, since almost every operating system has the ability to create or remove them.  Since Linux uses more than one partition on the same disk, even when using the standard installation procedure, this may seem strange at first.</para>
<para>The goal of having different partitions is primarily to achieve higher data security in case of disaster.  By dividing the hard disk in partitions, data can be grouped and separated.  When an accident occurs, only the data in the partition that got the hit will be damaged, while the data on the other partitions will most likely survive. </para>
<para>This principle dates from the days when Linux didn't have journaled file systems and power failures might have lead to disaster.  The use of partitions remains for security and robustness reasons, so a breach on one part of the system doesn't automatically mean that the whole computer is in danger.  This is currently the most important reason for partitioning.</para>
<para>Mind that having a journaled file system only provides data security in case of power failure and sudden disconnection of storage devices.  This does not protect your data against bad blocks and logical errors in the file system.  In those cases, you should use a RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) solution.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_03_01_02_02"><title>Partition layout and types</title>
<para>There are two kinds of major partitions on a Linux system:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis>data partition</emphasis>: normal Linux system data, including the <emphasis>root partition</emphasis> containing all the data to start up and run the system; and </para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>swap partition</emphasis>: expansion of the computer's physical memory, extra memory on hard disk.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Most systems contain a root partition, one or more data partitions and one or more swap partitions.  Systems in mixed environments may contain partitions for other system data, such as a partition with a FAT or VFAT file system for MS Windows data.</para>
<para>Most Linux systems use <command>fdisk</command> at installation time to set the partition type.  As you may have noticed during the exercise from Chapter 1, this usually happens automatically.  At some occasions, however, you may not be so lucky.  In such cases, you will need to select the partition type manually and even manually do the actual partitioning.  The standard Linux partitions have number 82 for swap and 83 for data, which can be journaled (ext3) or normal (ext2, on older systems).  The <command>fdisk</command> utility has built-in help, should you forget these values.</para>
<para>The standard root partition is about 100-500 MB, and contains the system configuration files, most basic commands and server programs, system libraries, some temporary space and the home directory of the administrative user.  A standard installation requires about 250 MB for the root partition.</para>
<para>Swap space is only accessible for the system itself, and is hidden from view during normal operation.  Swap is the system that ensures, like on normal UNIX systems, that you can keep on working, whatever happens.  On Linux, you will never see irritating messages like <emphasis>Out of memory, please close some applications first and try again</emphasis>, because of this extra memory.  Using memory on a hard disk is naturally slower than using the real memory chips of a computer, but having this little extra is a great comfort.  We will learn more about swap when we discuss Processes in <xref linkend="chap_04" />.</para>
<para>Linux generally counts on having twice the amount of physical memory in the form of swap space on the hard disk.  When installing a system, you have to know how you are going to do this.  An example on a system with 512 MB of RAM:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>1st possibility: one swap partition of 1 GB</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>2nd possibility: two swap partitions of 512 MB</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>3rd possibility: with two hard disks: 1 partition of 512 MB on each disk.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The last option will give the best results when a lot of I/O is to be expected.</para>
<para>Read the software documentation for specific guidelines.  Some applications, such as databases, might require more swap space.  Others, such as some handheld systems, might not have any swap at all by lack of a hard disk.  Swap space may also depend on your kernel version.</para>
<para>The rest of the hard disk(s) is generally divided in data partitions, although it may be that all of the non-system critical data resides on one partition, for example when you perform a standard workstation installation.  When non-critical data is separated on different partitions, it usually happens following a set pattern:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>a partition for user programs</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>a partition containing the users' personal data</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>a partition to store temporary data like print- and mail-queues</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>a partition for third party and extra software</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Once the partitions are made, you can only add more.  Changing sizes or properties of existing partitions is possible but not advisable.</para>
<para>The division of hard disks into partitions is determined by the system administrator.  On larger systems, he or she may even spread one partition over several hard disks, using the appropriate software.  Most distributions allow for standard setups optimized for workstations (average users) and for general server purposes, but also accept customized partitions.  During the installation process you can define your own partition layout using either Disk Druid, a straight forward graphical tool, or <command>fdisk</command>, a text-based tool for creating partitions and setting their properties.</para>
<para>A workstation or client installation is for use by mainly one and the same person.  The selected software for installation reflects this and the stress is on common user packages, such as nice desktop themes, development tools, client programs for E-mail, multimedia software, web and other services.  Everything is put together on one large partition, swap space twice the amount of RAM is added and your generic workstation is complete, providing the largest amount of disk space possible for personal use, but with the disadvantage of possible data integrity loss during problem situations.</para>
<para>On a server, system data tends to be separate from user data.  Programs that offer services are kept in a different place than the data handled by this service.  Different partitions will be created on such systems:</para>
<itemizedlist> 
<listitem><para>a partition with all data necessary to boot the machine</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>a partition with configuration data and server programs</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>one or more partitions containing the server data such as database tables, user mails, an ftp archive etc.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>a partition with user programs and application</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>one or more partitions for the user specific files (home directories)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>one or more swap partitions (virtual memory)</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist> 

<para>Servers usually have more memory and thus more swap space.  Certain server processes, such as databases, may require more swap space than usual; see the specific documentation for detailed information.  For better performance, swap is often divided into different swap partitions.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_03_01_02_03"><title>The df command</title>
<para>On a running system, information about the partitions can be displayed using the <command>df</command> command (which stands for <emphasis>disk full</emphasis>).  In Linux, <command>df</command> is the GNU version, and supports the <option>-h</option> or <emphasis>human readable</emphasis> option which greatly improves readability.  Note that commercial UNIX machines commonly have their own versions of <command>df</command> and many other commands.  Their behavior is usually the same, though GNU versions of common tools often have more and better features.</para>
<para>The <command>df</command> command only displays information about active non-swap partitions.  These can include partitions from other networked systems, like in the example below where the home directories are mounted from a file server on the network, a situation often encountered in corporate environments.</para>
<screen>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_03_01_03"><title>More file system layout</title>
<sect3 id="sect_03_01_03_01"><title>Visual</title>
<para>For convenience, the Linux file system is usually thought of in a tree structure.  On a standard Linux system, including RedHat, you will find the layout generally follows the scheme as presented below.</para>
<figure><title>Linux file system layout</title>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/FS-layout.eps" format="EPS"></imagedata>
</imageobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/FS-layout.png" format="PNG"></imagedata>
</imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<para>This is a layout from a RedHat system.  Depending on the system admin, the operating system and the mission of the UNIX machine, the structure may vary, and directories may be left out or added at will.  The names are not even required; they are only a convention.</para>
<para>The tree of the file system starts at the trunk or <emphasis>slash</emphasis>, indicated by a forward slash (/).  This directory, containing all underlying directories and files, is also called the <emphasis>root directory</emphasis>or <quote>the root</quote> of the file system.</para>
<para>Directories that are only one level below the root directory are often preceded by a slash, to indicate their position and prevent confusion with other directories that could have the same name.  When starting with a new system, it is always a good idea to take a look in the root directory.  Let's see what you could run into:</para>

<para>How can you find out which partition a directory is on?  Using the <command>df</command> command with a dot (.) as an option shows the partition the current directory belongs to, and informs about the amount of space used on this partition:</para>

sandra:/lib&gt;df -h .
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on

</screen>
<para>As a general rule, every directory under the root directory is on the root partition, unless it has a separate entry in the full listing from <command>df</command> (or <command>df -h</command> with no other options).</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="sect_03_01_03_02"><title>The file system in reality</title>
<para>For most users and for most common system administration tasks, it is enough to accept that files and directories are ordered in a tree-like structure.  The computer, however, doesn't understand a thing about trees or tree-structures.</para> 
<para>Every partition has its own file system.  By imagining all those file systems together, we can form an idea of the tree-structure of the entire system, but it is not as simple as that.  In a file system, a file is represented by an <emphasis>inode</emphasis>, a kind of serial number containing information about the actual data that makes up the file: to whom this file belongs, and where is it located on the hard disk.</para>
<para>Every partition has its own set of inodes; throughout a system with multiple partitions, files with the same inode number can exist.</para>
<para>Each inode describes a data structure on the hard disk, storing the properties of a file, including the physical location of the file data.  When a hard disk is initialized to accept data storage, usually during the initial system installation process or when adding extra disks to an existing system, a fixed number of inodes per partition is created.  This number will be the maximum amount of files, of all types (including directories, special files, links etc.) that can exist at the same time on the partition.  We typically count on having 1 inode per 2 to 8 kilobytes of storage.</para>
<para>At the time a new file is created, it gets a free inode.  In that inode is the following information:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Owner and group owner of the file.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>File type (regular, directory, ...)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Permissions on the file <xref linkend="sect_03_04_01" /></para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Date and time of creation, last read and change.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Date and time this information has been changed in the inode.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Number of links to this file (see later in this chapter).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>File size</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>An address defining the actual location of the file data.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>The only information not included in an inode, is the file name and directory.  These are stored in the special directory files.  By comparing file names and inode numbers, the system can make up a tree-structure that the user understands.  Users can display inode numbers using the <option>-i</option> option to ls.  The inodes have their own separate space on the disk.</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>

</sect1>
<sect1 id="sect_03_02"><title>Orientation in the file system</title>
<sect2 id="sect_03_02_01"><title>The path</title>
<para>When you want the system to execute a command, you don't always have to give the full path to that command.  For example, we know that the <command>ls</command> command is in the <filename>/bin</filename> directory (check with <command>which -a ls</command>), yet we don't have to enter the command <command>/bin/ls</command> for the computer to list the content of the current directory.</para>
<para>The <varname>PATH</varname> environment variable takes care of this.  This variable describes a set of paths or directories in the system where executable files can be found, and thus saves the user a lot of typing and memorizing locations of commands.  So the path naturally contains a lot of directories containing <filename>bin</filename> somewhere in their names:</para>
<screen>
rogier:&gt;echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin/:/bin
</screen>
<para>In this example, the directories <filename>/usr/local/bin</filename>, <filename>/usr/X11R6/bin</filename>, <filename>/usr/bin</filename>, <filename>/usr/sbin</filename>, <filename>/bin</filename> and the current directory (.) are subsequently searched for the required program.  As soon as a match is found, the search is stopped, even if not every directory in the path has been searched.  This can lead to strange situations.  In the first example below, the user knows there is a program called <command>sendsms</command> to send an SMS message, and another user on the same system can use it, but she can't.  The difference is in the configuration of the <varname>PATH</varname> variable:</para>
<screen>
[jenny@blob jenny]$ sendsms
bash: sendsms: command not found
[jenny@blob jenny]$ echo $PATH
/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/X11R6/bin:/home/clo/bin
[jenny@blob jenny]$ su - tony
Password:
tony:~&gt;which sendsms
sendsms is /usr/local/bin/sendsms

tony:~&gt;echo $PATH
/nethome/tony/bin.Linux:/nethome/tony/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:
/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin:.
</screen>
<para>Note the use of the <command>su</command> (switch user) facility, which allows you to run a shell in the environment of another user, on the condition that you know the user's password.</para>
<para>In the next example, a user wants to call on the <command>wc</command> (word count) command to check the number of lines in a file, but nothing happens and he has to break off his action using the [CTRL]-[C] combination:</para>
<screen>
jumper:~&gt;wc -l test

(CTRL-C)
jumper:~&gt;which wc
wc is hashed (/home/jumper/bin/wc)

jumper:~&gt;echo $PATH
/home/jumper/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin:
/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin:.
</screen>
<para>The use of the <command>which</command> command shows us that this user has a <filename>bin</filename>-directory in his home directory, containing a program that is also called <command>wc</command>.  Since the program in his home directory is found first when searching the paths upon a call for <command>wc</command>, this <quote>home-made</quote> program is executed, with input it probably doesn't understand, so we have to stop it.  To resolve this problem there are several ways (there are always several ways to solve a problem in UNIX/Linux): one answer could be to rename the user's <command>wc</command> program, or the user can give the full path to the exact command he wants, which can be found by using the <option>-a</option> to the <command>which</command> command:</para>
<screen>
jumper:~&gt;/usr/bin/wc -l test
       10 test
</screen>
<para>If the user uses programs in the other directories more frequently, he can change his path to look in his own directories last:</para>
<screen>
jumper:~&gt;export $PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin:
/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin:.:/home/jumper/bin
</screen>
<note><title>Changes are not permanent!</title>
<para>Note that when using the <command>export</command> command in a shell, the changes are temporary and only valid for this session (until you log out).  Opening new sessions, even while the current one is still running, will not result in a new path in the new session.  We will see in <xref linkend="chap_06" /> how we can make these kinds of changes to the environment permanent.</para></note>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_03_02_02"><title>Absolute and relative paths</title>
<para>A path, which is the way you need to follow in the tree structure to reach a given file, can be described as starting from the trunk of the tree (the / or root directory).  In that case, the path starts with a slash and is called an absolute path, since there can be no mistake: only one file on the system can comply.</para>
<para>In the other case, the path doesn't start with a slash and confusion is possible between <filename>~/bin/wc</filename> (in the user's home directory) and <filename>bin/wc</filename> in <filename>/usr</filename>, from the previous example.  Paths that don't start with a slash are always relative.</para>
<para>In relative paths we also use the . and .. indications for the current and the parent directory.  A couple of practical examples:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>When you want to compile source code, the installation documentation often instructs you to run the command <command>./configure</command>, which runs the <emphasis>configure</emphasis> program located in the current directory (that came with the new code), as opposed to running another configure program elsewhere on the system.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>In HTML files, relative paths are often used to make a set of pages easily movable to another place:</para>
<screen>
&lt;img alt="Een beeld" src="../images/beeld.jpg"&gt;

<sect3 id="sect_03_02_03_01"><title>The kernel</title>
<para>The kernel is the heart of the system.  It manages the communication between the underlaying hardware and the peripherals.  The kernel also makes sure that processes and daemons (server processes) are started and stopped at the exact right times.  The kernel has a lot of other important tasks, so many that there is a special kernel-development mailing list on this subject only, where huge amounts of information are shared.  It would lead us too far to discuss the kernel in detail.  For now it suffices to know that the kernel is the most important file on the system.</para>

<sect3 id="sect_03_02_03_02"><title>The shell</title>
<sect4><title>What is a shell?</title>
<para>When I was looking for an appropriate explanation on the concept of a <emphasis>shell</emphasis>, it gave me more trouble than I expected.  All kinds of definitions are available, ranging from the simple comparison that <quote>the shell is the steering wheel of the car</quote>, to the vague definition in the Bash manual which says that <quote>bash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter,</quote> or an even more obscure expression, <quote>a shell manages the interaction between the system and its users</quote>.  A shell is much more than that.</para>
<para>A shell can best be compared with a way of talking to the computer, a language.  Most users do know that other language, the click-and-point language of the desktop.  But in that language the user is treated as a baby, asked to pick from what is presented to him.</para>
<para>The shell, on the other hand, is an advanced way of communicating with the system, because it allows for conversation and taking initiative.  Both partners in the communication are equal, so new ideas can be tested.  The shell allows the user to handle a system in a flexible way, and is also a means of stress reduction.   Who does not appreciate being treated like an adult?</para>
</sect4>
<sect4><title>Shell types</title>
<para>Just like people know different languages and dialects, the computer knows different shell types:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><command>sh</command> or Bourne Shell: the original shell still used on UNIX systems and in UNIX related environments.  This is the basic shell, a small program with few features.  When in POSIX-compatible mode, <command>bash</command> will emulate this shell.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>bash</command> or Bourne Again shell: the standard GNU shell, intuitive and flexible.  Probably most advisable for beginning users while being at the same time a powerful tool for the advanced and professional user.  On Linux, <command>bash</command> is the standard shell for common users.  This shell is a so-called <emphasis>superset</emphasis> of the Bourne shell, a set of add-ons and plug-ins.  This means that the Bourne Again shell is compatible with the Bourne shell: commands that work in <command>sh</command>, also work in <command>bash</command>.  However, the reverse is not always the case.  All examples and exercises in this book use <command>bash</command>.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>csh</command> or C shell: the syntax of this shell resembles that of the C programming language.  Sometimes asked for by programmers.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>tcsh</command> or Turbo C shell: a superset of the common C shell, enhancing user-friendliness and speed.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>ksh</command> or the Korn shell: sometimes appreciated by people with a UNIX background.  A superset of the Bourne shell; with standard configuration a nightmare for beginning users.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>The file <filename>/etc/shells</filename> gives an overview of known shells on a Linux system:</para>
<screen>
mia:~&gt;cat /etc/shells
/bin/bash
/bin/sh
/bin/tcsh
/bin/csh
</screen>
<para>Your default shell is set in the <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> file, like this line for user <emphasis>mia</emphasis>:</para>
<screen>
mia:L2NOfqdlPrHwE:504:504:Mia Maya:/home/mia:/bin/bash
</screen>
<para>To switch from one shell to another, just enter the name of the new shell in the active terminal.  The system finds the directory where the name occurs using the <varname>PATH</varname> settings, en since a shells is an executable files (program), the current shell activates it and it gets executed.  A new prompt is usually shown, because each shell has its typical appearance:</para>
<screen>
mia:~&gt;tcsh
[mia@post21 ~]$
</screen>
</sect4>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_03_02_03_03"><title>Your home directory</title>

<para>Your home directory is your default destination when connecting to the system.  In most cases it is a subdirectory of <filename>/home</filename>, though this may vary.  Your home directory may be located on the hard disk of a remote file server; in that case your home directory may be found in <filename>/nethome/your_user_name</filename>.  In another case the system administrator may have opted for a less comprehensible layout and your home directory may be on <filename>/disk6/HU/07/dgillard</filename>.</para>
<para>Whatever the path to your home directory, you don't have to worry too much about it.  The correct path to your home directory is stored in the <varname>HOME</varname> environment variable, in case some program needs it.  With the <command>echo</command> command you can display the content of this variable:</para>
<screen>
orlando:~&gt;echo $HOME
/nethome/orlando
</screen>
<para>You can do whatever you like in your home directory.  You can put as many files in as many directories as you want, although the total amount of data and files is naturally limited because of the hardware and size of the partitions, and sometimes because the system administrator has applied a quota system.  Limiting disk usage was common practice when hard disk space was still expensive.  Nowadays, limits are almost exclusively applied in large environments.  You can see for yourself if a limit is set using the <command>quota</command> command:</para>
<screen>
pierre@lamaison:/&gt;quota -v
Diskquotas for user pierre (uid 501): none
</screen>
<para>In case quotas have been set, you get a list of the limited partitions and their specific limitations.  Excessing the limits may be tolerated during a grace period with porer or no restrictions at all.  Detailed information can be found using the <command>info quota</command> or <command>man quota</command> commands.</para>
<para>Your home directory is indicated by a tilde (~), shorthand for <filename>/path_to_home/user_name</filename>.  This same path is stored in the <varname>HOME</varname> variable, so you don't have to do anything to activate it.  A simple application: switch from <filename>/var/music/albums/arno/2001</filename> to <filename>images</filename> in your home directory using one elegant command:</para>
<screen>
rom:/var/music/albums/arno/2001&gt;cd ~/images

rom:~/images&gt;pwd
/home/rom/images
</screen>
<para>Later in this chapter we will talk about the commands for managing files and directories in order to keep your home directory tidy.</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_03_02_04"><title>The most important configuration files</title>
<para>As we mentioned before, most configuration files are stored in the <filename>/etc</filename> directory.  Content can be viewed using the <command>cat</command> command, which sends text files to the standard output (usually your monitor).  The syntax is straight forward:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>cat <filename>file1</filename> <filename>file2</filename> ... <filename>fileN</filename></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>In this section we try to give an overview of the most common configuration files.  This is certainly not a complete list.  Adding extra packages may also add extra configuration files in <filename>/etc</filename>.  When reading the configuration files, you will find that they are usually quite well commented and self-explanatory.  Some files also have man pages which contain extra documentation, such as <command>man aliases</command>.</para>

<para>Devices, generally every peripheral attachment of a PC that is not the CPU itself, is presented to the system as an entry in the <filename>/dev</filename> directory.  On of the advantages of this UNIX-way of handling devices is that neither the user nor the system has to worry much about the specification of devices.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_03_02_06"><title>The most common variable files</title>

<para>In the <filename>/var</filename> directory we find a set of directories for storing specific non-constant data (as opposed to the ls program or the system configuration files, which change relatively infrequently or never at all).  All files that change frequently, such as log files, mailboxes, lock files, spoolers etc. are kept in a subdirectory of <filename>/var</filename>.</para>
<para>As a security measure these files are usually kept in separate parts from the main system files, so we can keep a close eye on them and set stricter permissions where necessary.  A lot of these files also need more permissions than usual, like <filename>/var/tmp</filename>, which needs to be writable for everyone.  A lot of user activity might be expected here, which might even be generated by anonymous Internet users connected to your system.  This is one reason why the <filename>/var</filename> directory, including all its subdirectories, is usually on a separate partition.  This way, there is for instance no risk that a mail bomb fills up your root file system, containing more important data such as your programs and configuration files.</para>
<para>One of the main security systems on a UNIX system, which is naturally implemented on every Linux machine as well, is the log-keeping facility, which logs all user actions, processes, system events etc.  The configuration file of the so-called <emphasis>syslogdaemon</emphasis> determines which and how long logged information will be kept.  The default location of all logs is <filename>/var/log</filename>, containing different files for access log, server logs, system messages etc.</para>
<para>In <filename>/var</filename> we typically find server data, which is kept here to separate it from critical data such as the server program itself and its configuration files.  A typical example on Linux systems is <filename>/var/www</filename>, which contains the actual HTML pages, scripts and images that a web server offers.  The FTP-tree of an FTP server (data that can be downloaded by a remote client) is also best kept in one of <filename>/var</filename>'s subdirectories.  Because this data is publicly accessible and often changeable by anonymous users, it is safer to keep it here, away from partitions or directories with sensitive data.</para>
<para>On most workstation installations, <filename>/var/spool</filename> will at least contain an <filename>at</filename> and a <filename>cron</filename> directory, containing scheduled tasks.  In office environments this directory usually contains <filename>lpd</filename> as well, which holds the print queue(s) and further printer configuration files, as well as the printer log files.</para>
<para>On server systems we will generally find <filename>/var/spool/mail</filename>, containing incoming mails for local users, sorted in one file per user, the user's <quote>inbox</quote>.  A related directory is <filename>mqueue</filename>, the spooler area for unsent mail messages.  These parts of the system can be very busy on mail servers with a lot of users.  News servers also use the <filename>/var/spool</filename> area because of the enormous amounts of messages they have to process.</para>
<para>Newer RedHat systems use this space for keeping track of packages to update (<filename>/var/spool/up2date</filename>) and for storing tasks scheduled by <command>anacron</command>.  Later more about scheduling, see <xref linkend="chap_04" />.</para>
<para>The <filename>/var/lib/rpm</filename> directory is specific to RedHat installations; it is where package information is stored.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_03_03_01"><title>Viewing file properties</title>
<sect3 id="sect_03_03_01_01"><title>More about ls</title>
<para>Besides the name of the file, <command>ls</command> can give a lot of other information, such as the file type, as we already discussed.  It can also show permissions on a file, file size, inode number, creation date and time, owners and amount of links to the file.  With the <option>-a</option> option to <command>ls</command>, files that are normally hidden from view can be displayed as well.  These are files that have a name starting with a dot.  A couple of typical examples include the configuration files in your home directory.  When you've worked with a certain system for a while, you will notice that tens of files and directories have been created that are not automatically listed in a directory index.  Next to that, every directory contains a file named just dot (.) and one with two dots (..), which are used in combination with their inode number to determine the directory's position in the file system's tree structure.</para>
<para>You should really read the Info pages about <command>ls</command>, since it is a very common command with a lot of useful options.  Options can be combined, as is the case with most UNIX commands and their options.  A common combination is <command>ls -al</command>; it shows a long list of files and their properties as well as the destinations that any symbolic links point to.  <command>ls -latr</command> displays the same files, only now in reversed order of the last change, so that the file changed most recently occurs at the bottom of the list.  Here are a couple of examples:</para>

<para>On most Linux versions <command>ls</command> is <emphasis>aliased</emphasis> to color-ls by default.  This feature allows to see the file type without using any options to <command>ls</command>.  To achieve this, every file type has its own color.  The standard scheme is in <filename>/etc/DIR_COLORS</filename>:</para>

<sect3 id="sect_03_03_02_01"><title>Making a mess...</title>
<para>... Is not a difficult thing to do.  Today almost every system is networked, so naturally files get copied from one machine to another.  And especially when working in a graphical environment, creating new files is a piece of cake and is often done without the approval of the user.  To illustrate the problem, here's the full content of a new user's directory, created on a standard RedHat system:</para>
<screen>
[newuser@blob user]$ ls -al
total 32

<para>On first sight, the content of a <quote>used</quote> home directory doesn't look that bad either:</para>

</screen>
<para>But when all the directories and files starting with a dot are included, there are 185 items in this directory.  This is because most applications have their own directories and/or files, containing user-specific settings, in the home directory of that user.  Usually these files are created the first time you start an application.  In some cases you will be notified when a non-existent directory needs to be created, but most of the time everything is done automatically.</para>
<para>Furthermore, new files are created seemingly continuously because users want to save files, keep different versions of their work, use Internet applications, and download files and attachments to their local machine.  It doesn't stop.  It is clear that one definitely needs a scheme to keep an overview on things.</para>
<para>In the next section, we will discuss our means of keeping order.  We only discuss text tools available to the shell, since graphical tools, such as the Nautilus file manager that comes with most distributions, are very intuitive and have the same look and feel as the well known point-and-click MS Windows-style file managers, including graphical help functions and other features you expect from this kind of applications.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_03_03_02_03"><title>The tools</title>
<sect4><title>Creating directories</title>
<para>A way of keeping things in place is to give certain files specific default locations by creating directories and subdirectories (or folders and sub-folders if you wish).  This is done with the <command>mkdir</command> command:</para>
<screen>
richard:~&gt;mkdir archive

richard:~&gt;ls -ld archive

richard:~/archive&gt;ls

richard:~/archive&gt;mkdir 2001/reports/Restaurants-Michelin/
mkdir: cannot create directory `2001/reports/Restaurants-Michelin/':
No such file or directory

richard:~/archive&gt;mkdir -p 2001/reports/Restaurants-Michelin/

richard:~/archive&gt;ls 2001/reports/
Restaurants-Michelin/
</screen>
<para>If the new file needs other permissions than the default file creation permissions, the new access rights can be set in one move, still using the <command>mkdir</command> command, see the Info pages for more.  We are going to discuss access modes in the next section on File Security.</para>
<para>The name of a directory has to comply with the same rules as those applied on regular file names.  One of the most important restrictions is that you can't have two files with the same name in one directory (but keep in mind that Linux is, like UNIX, a case sensitive operating system).  There are virtually no limits on the length of a file name, but it is usually kept shorter than 80 characters, so it can fit on one line of a terminal.  You can use any character you want in a file name, although it is advised to exclude characters that have a special meaning to the shell.  When in doubt, check with <xref linkend="app3" />.</para>
</sect4>
<sect4><title>Moving files</title>
<para>Now that we have properly structured our home directory, it is time to clean up unclassified files using the <command>mv</command> command:</para>
<screen>
richard:~/archive&gt;mv ../report[1-4].doc reports/Restaurants-Michelin/
</screen>
<para>This command is also applicable when renaming files:</para>
<screen>
richard:~&gt;ls To_Do
-rw-rw-r--    1 richard richard      5 Jan 15 12:39 To_Do

richard:~&gt;mv To_Do done

richard:~&gt;ls -l done
-rw-rw-r--    1 richard richard      5 Jan 15 12:39 done
</screen>
<para>It is clear that only the name of the file changes.  All other properties remain the same.</para>
<para>Detailed information about the syntax and features of the <command>mv</command> command can be found in the man or Info pages.  The use of this documentation should always be your first reflex when confronted with a problem.  The answer to your problem is likely to be in the system documentation.  Even experienced users read man pages every day, so beginning users should read them all the time.  After a while, you will get to know the most common options to the common commands, but you will still need the documentation as a primary source of information.  Note that the information contained in the HOWTOs, FAQs, man pages and such is slowly being merged into the Info pages, which are today the most up-to-date source of online (as in readily available on the system) documentation.</para>
</sect4>
<sect4><title>Copying files</title>
<para>Copying files and directories is done with the <command>cp</command> command.  A useful option is recursive copy (copy all underlying files and subdirectories), using the <option>-R</option> option to <command>cp</command>.  The general syntax is</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>cp [<option>-R</option>] <filename>fromfile</filename> <filename>tofile</filename></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>As an example is the case of user <emphasis>newguy</emphasis>, who wants the same Gnome desktop settings user <emphasis>oldguy</emphasis> has.  One way to solve the problem is to copy the settings of <emphasis>oldguy</emphasis> to the home directory of <emphasis>newguy</emphasis>:</para>
<screen>
victor:~&gt;cp -R ../oldguy/.gnome/ .
</screen>
<para>This gives some errors involving file permissions, but all the errors have to do with private files that <emphasis>newguy</emphasis> doesn't need anyway.  We will discuss in the next part how to change these permissions in case they really are a problem.</para>

</sect4>
<sect4><title>Removing files</title>
<para>Use the <command>rm</command> command to remove single files, <command>rmdir</command> to remove empty directories.  (Use <command>ls -a</command> to check whether a directory is empty or not).  The <command>rm</command> command also has options for removing non-empty directories with all their subdirectories, read the Info pages for these rather dangerous options.</para>
<note><title>How empty can a directory be?</title>
<para>It is normal that the directories . (dot) and .. (dot-dot) can't be removed, since they are also necessary in an empty directory to determine the directories ranking in the file system hierarchy.</para></note>
<para>On Linux, just like on UNIX, there is no garbage can - at least not for the shell, although there are plenty of solutions for graphical use.  So once removed, a file is really gone, and there is generally no way to get it back unless you have backups, or you are really fast and have a real good system administrator.  To protect the beginning user from this malice, the interactive behavior of the <command>rm</command>, <command>cp</command> and <command>mv</command> commands can be activated using the <option>-i</option> option.  In that case the system won't immediately act upon request.  Instead it will ask for confirmation, so it takes an additional click on the [ENTER]-key to inflict the damage:</para>
<screen>
mary:~&gt;rm -ri archive/
rm: descend into directory `archive'? y
rm: descend into directory `archive/reports'? y
rm: remove directory `archive/reports'? y
rm: descend into directory `archive/backup'? y
rm: remove `archive/backup/sysbup200112.tar'? y
rm: remove directory `archive/backup'? y
rm: remove directory `archive'? y
</screen>
<para>We will discuss how to make this option the default in <xref linkend="chap_07" />, which discusses customizing your shell environment.</para> 
</sect4>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_03_03_03"><title>Finding files</title>
<sect3 id="sect_03_03_03_01"><title>Using shell features</title>
<para>In the example on moving files we already saw how the shell can manipulate multiple files at once.  In that example, the shell finds out automatically what the user means by the requirements between the squarebraces <quote>[</quote> and <quote>]</quote>.  The shell can substitute ranges of numbers and upper or lower case characters alike.  It also substitutes as many characters as you want with an asterisk, and only one character with a question mark.</para>
<para>All sorts of substitutions can be used simultaneously; the shell is very logical about it.  The Bash shell, for instance, has no problem with expressions like <command>ls dirname/*/*/*[2-3]</command>.</para>
<para>In other shells, the asterisk is commonly used to minimize the efforts of typing:  people would enter <command>cd dir*</command> instead of <command>cd directory</command>.  In Bash however, this is not necessary because the GNU shell has a feature called file name completion.  It means that you can type the first few characters of a command (anywhere) or a file (in the current directory) and if no confusion is possible, the shell will find out what you mean.   For example in a directory containing many files, you can check if there are any files beginning with the letter A just by typing <command>ls A</command>and pressing the [TAB]-key twice, rather than pressing [ENTER].  If there is only one file starting with A, this file will be shown as the argument to <command>ls</command> (or any shell command, for that matter) immediately.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_03_03_03_02"><title>Which</title>
<para>A very simple way of looking up files is using the <command>which</command> command, to look in the directories listed in the user's search path for the required file.  Of course, since the search path contains only paths to directories containing executable programs, <command>which</command> doesn't work for ordinary files.  The <command>which</command> command is useful when troubleshooting <quote>Command not Found</quote> problems.  In the example below, user <emphasis>tina</emphasis> can't use the <command>acroread</command> program, while her colleague has no troubles whatsoever on the same system.  The problem is similar to the PATH problem in the previous part: Tina's colleague tells her that he can see the required program in <filename>/opt/acroread/bin</filename>, but this directory is not in her path:</para>
<screen>
tina:~&gt;which acroread
/usr/bin/which: no acroread in (/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11)
</screen>
<para>The problem can be solved by giving the full path to the command to run, or by re-exporting the content of the <varname>PATH</varname> variable:</para>
<screen>
tina:~&gt;export PATH=$PATH:/opt/acroread/bin

tina:~&gt;echo $PATH
/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/opt/acroread/bin
</screen>
<para>Using the <command>which</command> command also checks to see if a command is an alias for another command:</para>
<screen>
gerrit:~&gt;which -a ls
ls is aliased to `ls -F --color=auto'
ls is /bin/ls

gerrit:~&gt;which -a which
which is aliased to `type'
which is /usr/bin/which

gerrit:~&gt;which type
type is a shell builtin
</screen>
<para>This actually means that <command>which</command> is built-in in the shell, but that there is also a <command>which</command> <quote>stand alone version</quote>.  The shell built-in version precedes the <command>which</command> in <filename>/usr/bin</filename>, which is still there for compatibility with UNIX.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_03_03_03_03"><title>Find and locate</title>
<para>These are the real tools, used when searching other paths beside those listed in the search path.  The <command>find</command> tool, known from UNIX, is very powerful, which may be the cause of a somewhat more difficult syntax.  GNU <command>find</command>, however, deals with the syntax problems.  This command not only allows you to search file names, it can also accept file size, date of last change and other file properties as criteria for a search.  The most common use is for finding file names:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>find <filename>&lt;path&gt;</filename> -name &lt;searchstring&gt;</command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>This can be interpreted as <quote>Look in all files and subdirectories contained in a given path, and print the names of the files containing the search string in their name</quote> (not in their content).</para>
<para>Another application of <command>find</command> is for searching files of a certain size, as in the example below, where user <emphasis>peter</emphasis> wants to find all files in the current directory or one of its subdirectories, that are bigger than 5 MB:</para>
<screen>
peter:~&gt;find . -size +5000k
Samson_En_Gert_8.12_Samson_is_de_liefste_hond.mp3
</screen>
<para>Later on (1999 according to the man pages, after 20 years of <command>find</command>), <command>locate</command> was developed.  This program is easier to use, but more restricted than <command>find</command>, since its output is based on a file index database that is updated only once every day.  On the other hand, a search in the <command>locate</command> database is less time- and CPU-consuming than a search with <command>find</command>.</para>
<para>Most Linux distributions use <command>slocate</command> these days, security enhanced locate, the modern version of <command>locate</command> that prevents users from getting output they have no right to read.  The files in <emphasis>root</emphasis>'s home directory are such an example, these are not normally accessible to the public.  A user who wants to find someone who knows about the C-shell may issue the command <command>locate .cshrc</command>, to display all users who have a customized configuration file for the C shell.  Supposing the users <emphasis>root</emphasis> and <emphasis>jenny</emphasis> are running C shell, then only the file <filename>/home/jenny/.cshrc</filename> will be displayed, and not the one in <emphasis>root</emphasis>'s home directory.  On most systems, <command>locate</command> is a symbolic link to the <command>slocate</command> program:</para>
<screen>
billy:~&gt;ls -l /usr/bin/locate
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root  slocate  7 Oct 28 14:18 /usr/bin/locate -&gt; slocate*
</screen>
<para>User <emphasis>tina</emphasis> could have used <command>locate</command> to find the application she wanted:</para>
<screen>
tina:~&gt;locate acroread
/usr/share/icons/hicolor/16x16/apps/acroread.png
/usr/share/icons/hicolor/32x32/apps/acroread.png
/usr/share/icons/locolor/16x16/apps/acroread.png
/usr/share/icons/locolor/32x32/apps/acroread.png
/usr/local/bin/acroread
/usr/local/Acrobat4/Reader/intellinux/bin/acroread
/usr/local/Acrobat4/bin/acroread
</screen>
<para>Directories that don't contain the name <filename>bin</filename> can't contain the program - they don't contain executable files.  There are three possibilities left.  The file in <filename>/usr/local/bin</filename> is the one <emphasis>tina</emphasis> would have wanted: it is a link to the shell script that starts the actual program:</para>
<screen>
tina:~&gt;file /usr/local/bin/acroread
/usr/local/bin/acroread: symbolic link to ../Acrobat4/bin/acroread

tina:~&gt;file /usr/local/Acrobat4/bin/acroread
/usr/local/Acrobat4/bin/acroread: Bourne shell script text executable

tina:~&gt;file /usr/local/Acrobat4/Reader/intellinux/bin/acroread
/usr/local/Acrobat4/Reader/intellinux/bin/acroread: ELF 32-bit LSB executable,
Intel 80386, version 1, dynamically linked (uses shared libs), not stripped
</screen>
<para>In order to keep the path as short as possible, so the system doesn't have to search too long every time a user wants to execute a command, we add <filename>/usr/local/bin</filename> to the path and not the other directories, which only contain the binary files of one specific program, while <filename>/usr/local/bin</filename> contains other useful programs as well.</para>
<para>Again, a description of the full features of <command>find</command> and <command>locate</command> can be found in the Info pages.</para>

<sect3 id="sect_03_03_03_04"><title>The grep command</title>
<para>A simple but powerful program, <command>grep</command> is used for filtering input lines and returning certain patterns to the output.  There are literally thousands of applications for the <command>grep</command> program.  In the example below, <emphasis>jerry</emphasis> uses <command>grep</command> to see how he did the thing with <command>find</command>:</para>
<screen>
jerry:~&gt;grep -a find .bash_history
find . -name userinfo
man find
find ../ -name common.cfg
</screen>
<note><title>Search history</title>
<para>Also useful in these cases is the search function in <command>bash</command>, activated by pressing [CTRL] and [R] at once, such as in the example where we want to check how we did that last <command>find</command> again:</para>
<screen>
thomas ~&gt; 
(reverse-i-search)`find': find `/home/thomas` -name *.xml
</screen>
<para>Type your search string at the search prompt.  The more characters you type, the more restricted the search gets.  This reads the command history for this shell session (which is written to <filename>.bash_history</filename> in your home directory when you quit that session).  The most recent occurance of your search string is shown.  If you want to see previous commands containing the same string, type [CTRL] + [R] again.</para>
<para>See the Info pages on <command>bash</command> for more.</para></note>
<para>All UNIXes with just a little bit of decency have an online dictionary.  So does Linux.  The dictionary is a list of known words in a file named <filename>words</filename>, located in <filename>/usr/share/dict</filename>.  To quickly check the correct spelling of a word, no graphical application is needed:</para>
<screen>
william:~&gt;grep pinguin /usr/share/dict/words

william:~&gt;grep penguin /usr/share/dict/words
penguin

<sect3 id="sect_03_03_04_01"><title>General</title>
<para>Apart from <command>cat</command>, which really doesn't do much more than sending files to the standard output, there are other tools to view file content.</para>
<para>The easiest way of course would be to use graphical tools instead of command line tools.  In the introduction we already saw a glimpse of an office application, OpenOffice.  Other examples are the GIMP (start up with <command>gimp</command> from the command line), the GNU Image Manipulation Program; <command>xpdf</command> to view Portable Document Format files (PDF); GhostView (<command>gv</command>) for viewing PostScript files; the Mozilla Project, <command>links</command> (a text mode browser), Konqueror, Opera and many others for web content; XMMS, CDplay and others for multi-media file content; AbiWord, Gnumeric, KOffice etc. for all kinds of office applications and so on.  There are thousands of Linux applications; to list them all would take days.</para>
<para>Instead we keep concentrating on shell- or text-mode applications, which form the basics for all other applications.  These commands work best in a text environment on files containing text.  When in doubt, check first using the <command>file</command> command.</para>
<para>So let's see what text tools we have that are useful to look inside files.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_03_03_04_02"><title><quote><command>Less</command> is <command>more</command></quote></title>
<para>Undoubtedly you will here someone say this phrase sooner or later when working in a UNIX environment.  A little bit of UNIX history explains this:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>First there was <command>cat</command>.  Output was streamed in an uncontrollable way.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Then there was <command>pg</command>, which may still be found on older UNIXes.  This command puts text to the output one page at the time.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The <command>more</command> program was a revised version of <command>pg</command>.  This command is still available on every Linux system.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>less</command> is the GNU version of more and has extra features allowing highlighting of search strings, scrolling back etc.  The syntax is very simple:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>less <filename>file</filename></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>More information is located in the Info pages.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_03_03_04_03"><title><command>Head</command> and <command>tail</command></title>
<para>These two commands display the n first/last lines of a file respectively.  To see the last ten commands entered:</para>
<screen>
tony:~>tail -10 .bash_history 
locate configure | grep bin
man bash
cd
xawtv &amp;
grep useable /usr/share/dict/words 
grep advisable /usr/share/dict/words 
info quota

<para><command>head</command> works similarly.  The <command>tail</command> command has a handy feature to continuously show the last n lines of a file that changes all the time.

<sect2 id="sect_03_03_05"><title>Linking files</title>
<sect3 id="sect_03_03_05_01"><title>Link types</title>
<para>Since we know more about files and their representation in the file system, understanding links (or shortcuts) is a piece of cake.  A link is nothing more than a way of matching two or more file names to the same set of file data.  There are two ways to achieve this:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Hard link: Associate two or more file names with the same inode.  Hard links share the same data blocks on the hard disk, while they continue to behave as independent files.</para>
<para>There is an immediate disadvantage: hard links can't span partitions, because inode numbers are only unique within a given partition.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Soft link or symbolic link (or for short: symlink): a small file that is a pointer to another file.  A symbolic link contains the path to the target file instead of a physical location on the hard disk.  Since inodes are not used in this system, soft links can span across partitions.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The two link types behave similar, but are not the same, as illustrated in the scheme below:</para>
<figure><title>Hard and soft link mechanism</title>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/links.eps" format="EPS"></imagedata>
</imageobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/links.png" format="PNG"></imagedata>
</imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<para>Note that removing the target file for a symbolic link makes the link useless.</para>
<para>Each regular file is principally a hardlink.  Hardlinks can not span across partitions, since they refer to inodes, and inode numbers are only unique within a given partition.</para>
<para>It may be argued that there is a third kind of link, the <emphasis>user-space</emphasis> link, which is similar to a shortcut in MS Windows.  These are files containing meta-data which can only be interpreted by the graphical file manager.  To the kernel and the shell these are just normal files.  They may end in a <emphasis>.desktop</emphasis> or <emphasis>.lnk</emphasis> suffix; an example can be found in <filename>~/.gnome-desktop</filename>:</para>
<screen>
[dupont@boulot .gnome-desktop]$ cat La\ Maison\ Dupont
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=Legacy-Mixed
Name=La Maison Dupont
Type=X-nautilus-home
X-Nautilus-Icon=temp-home
URL=file:///home/dupont
</screen>
<para>This example is from a KDE desktop:</para>
<screen>
[lena@venus Desktop]$ cat camera
[Desktop Entry]
Dev=/dev/sda1
FSType=auto
Icon=memory
MountPoint=/mnt/camera
Type=FSDevice
X-KDE-Dynamic-Device=true
</screen>
<para>Creating this kind of link is easy enough using the features of your graphical environment.  Should you need help, your system documentation should be your first resort.</para>
<para>In the next section, we will study the creation of UNIX-style symbolic links using the command line.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_03_03_05_02"><title>Creating symbolic links</title>
<para>The symbolic link is particularly interesting for beginning users: they are fairly obvious to see and you don't need to worry about partitions.</para>
<para>The command to make links is <command>ln</command>.  In order to create symlinks, you need to use the <option>-s</option> option:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>ln -s <filename>targetfile</filename> <filename>linkname</filename></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>In the example below, user <emphasis>freddy</emphasis> creates a link in a subdirectory of his homedirectory to a directory on another part of the system:</para>
<screen>
freddy:~/music&gt;ln -s /opt/mp3/Queen/ Queen

freddy:~/music&gt;ls -l
lrwxrwxrwx  1 freddy  freddy  17 Jan 22 11:07 Queen -&gt; /opt/mp3/Queen
</screen>
<para>Symbolic links are always very small files, while hard links have the same size as the original file.</para>
<para>The application of symbolic links is widespread.  They are often used to save disk space, to make a copy of a file in order to satisfy installation requirements of a new program that expects the file to be in another location, they are used to fix scripts that suddenly have to run in a new environment and can generally save a lot of work.  A system admin may decide to move the home directories of the users to a new location, <filename>disk2</filename> for instance, but if he wants everything to work like before, like the <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> file, with a minimum of effort he will create a symlink from <filename>/home</filename> to the new location <filename>/disk2/home</filename>.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1 id="sect_03_04"><title>File security</title>
<sect2 id="sect_03_04_01"><title>Access rights: Linux's first line of defense</title>
<para>The Linux security model is based on the one used on UNIX systems, and is as rigid, and in some cases even more, as the UNIX security model, which is already quite robust.  On a Linux system, every file is owned by a user and a group user.  There is also a third category of users, those that are not the user owner and don't belong to the group owning the file.  For each category of users, read, write and execute permissions can be granted or denied.</para>
<para>We already used the <emphasis>long</emphasis> option to list files using the <command>ls -l</command> command, though for other reasons.  This command also displays file permissions for these three user categories; they are indicated by the nine characters that follow the first character, which is the file type indicator at the beginning of the file properties line.  As seen in the examples below, the first three characters in this series of nine display access rights for the actual user that owns the file.  The next three are for the group owner of the file, the last three for other users.  The permissions are always in the same order: read, write, execute for the user, the group and the others.  Some examples:</para>
<screen>
marise:~&gt;ls -l To_Do
-rw-rw-r--    1 marise  users      5 Jan 15 12:39 To_Do
marise:~&gt;ls -l /bin/ls
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root    root   45948 Aug  9 15:01 /bin/ls*
</screen>
<para>The first file is a regular file (first dash).  Users with user name <emphasis>marise</emphasis> or users belonging to the group <emphasis>users</emphasis> can read and write (change/move/delete) the file, but they can't execute it (second and third dash).  All other users are only allowed to read this file, but they can't write or execute it (fourth and fifth dash).</para>
<para>The second example is an executable file, the difference: everybody can run this program, but you need to be <emphasis>root</emphasis> to change it.</para>
<para>The Info pages explain how the <command>ls</command> command handles display of access rights in detail, see the section <emphasis>What information is listed</emphasis>.</para>
<para>For easy use with commands, both access rights or modes and user groups have a code.  See the tables below.</para>

<para>This straight forward scheme is applied very strictly, which allows a high level of security even without network security.  Among other functions, the security scheme takes care of user access to programs, it can serve files on a need-to-know basis and protect sensitive data such as home directories and system configuration files.</para>
<para>You should know what your user name is.  If you don't, it can be displayed using the <command>id</command> command, which also displays the default group you belong to and eventually other groups of which you are a member:</para>

<sect2 id="sect_03_04_02"><title>The tools</title>
<sect3 id="sect_03_04_02_01"><title>The chmod command</title>
<para>A normal consequence of applying strict file permissions, and sometimes a nuisance, is that access rights will need to be changed for all kinds of reasons.  We use the <command>chmod</command> command to do this, and eventually <emphasis>to chmod</emphasis> has become an almost acceptable English verb, meaning the changing of the access mode of a file.  The <command>chmod</command> command can be used with alphanumeric or numeric options, whatever you like best.</para>
<para>The example below uses alphanumeric options  in order to solve a problem that commonly occurs with new users:</para>
<screen>
asim:~&gt;./hello
bash: ./hello: bad interpreter: Permission denied

asim:~&gt;cat hello
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World"

asim:~&gt;ls -l hello
-rw-rw-r--    1 asim    asim    32 Jan 15 16:29 hello

asim:~&gt;chmod u+x hello

asim:~&gt;./hello
Hello, World

asim:~&gt;ls -l hello
-rwx-rw-r--   1 asim    asim    32 Jan 15 16:29 hello*
</screen>
<para>The + and - operators are used to grant or deny a given right to a given group.  Combinations separated by commas are allowed.  The Info and man pages contain useful examples.  Here's another one, which makes the file from the previous example a private file to user <emphasis>asim</emphasis>:</para>
<screen>
asim:~&gt;chmod u+rwx,go-rwx hello

asim:~&gt;ls -l hello
-rwx------    1 asim    asim    32 Jan 15 16:29 hello*
</screen>
<para>The kind of problem resulting in an error message saying that permission is denied somewhere is usually a problem with access rights in most cases.  Also, comments like, <quote>It worked yesterday,</quote> and <quote>When I run this as root it works,</quote> are most likely caused by the wrong file permissions.</para>
<para>When using <command>chmod</command> with numeric arguments, the values for each granted access right have to be counted together per group.  Thus we get a 3-digit number, which is the symbolic value for the settings <command>chmod</command> has to make.  The following table lists the most common combinations:</para>

<para>If you enter a number with less than three digits as an argument to <command>chmod</command>, omitted characters are replaced with zeros starting from the left.

<sect3 id="sect_03_04_02_02"><title>The file mask</title>
<para>When a new file is saved somewhere, it is first subjected to the standard security procedure.  The standard file permission is determined by the <emphasis>mask</emphasis> for new file creation.  The value of this mask can be displayed using the <command>umask</command> command:</para>

<para>Instead of adding the symbolic values to each other, they need to be subtracted from the total possible access rights.

<sect3 id="sect_03_04_02_03"><title>Changing user and group ownership</title>
<para>When a file is owned by the wrong user or group, the error can be repaired with the <command>chown</command> (change owner) and <command>chgrp</command> (change group) commands.  Changing file ownership is a frequent task in environments where files need to be shared in a group.  Both commands are very flexible, as you can find out by using the <option>--help</option> option.</para>
<para>The <command>chown</command> command can be applied to change both user and group ownership of a file, while <command>chgrp</command> only changes group ownership.  Of course the system will check if the user issuing one of these commands has sufficient permissions on the file(s) she wants to change.</para>
<para>In order to only change the user ownership of a file, use this syntax:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>chown <option>newuser</option> <filename>file</filename></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>If you use a colon after the user name (see the Info pages), group ownership will be changed as well, to the primary group of the user issuing the command.  On a Linux system, each user has his own group, so this form can be used to make files private:</para>

<sect3 id="sect_03_04_02_04"><title>Special modes</title>
<para>For the system admin to not be bothered solving permission problems all the time, special access rights can be given to entire directories, or to separate programs.  There are three special modes:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Sticky bit mode: After execution of a job, the command is kept in the system memory.  Originally this was a feature used a lot to save memory, but these days memory is inexpensive, so it is not used anymore for its optimizing capabilities on single files.  When applied to an entire directory, however, the sticky bit has a different meaning.  In that case, a user can only change files in this directory when she is the user owner of the file or when the file has appropriate permissions.  This feature is used on directories like <filename>/var/tmp</filename>, that have to be accessible for everyone, but where it is not appropriate for users to change or delete each other's data.  The sticky bit is indicated by a <emphasis>t</emphasis> at the end of the file permission field:</para>
<screen>
mark:~&gt;ls -ld /var/tmp
drwxrwxrwt   19 root     root         8192 Jan 16 10:37 /var/tmp/

<para>The sticky bit is set using the command <command>chmod u+t <filename>directory</filename></command>.  The historic origin of the <quote>t</quote> is in UNIX' <emphasis>save Text access</emphasis> feature.</para>

<listitem><para>SUID (set user ID) and SGID (set group ID): represented by the character <emphasis>s</emphasis> in the user or group permission field.  When this mode is set on an executable file, it will run with the user and group permissions on the file instead of with those of the user issuing the command, thus giving access to system resources.  We will discuss this further in <xref linkend="chap_04" />.</para>

<listitem><para>SGID (set group ID) on a directory: in this special case every file created in the directory will have the same group owner as the directory itself (while normal behavior would be that new files are owned by the users who create them).  This way, users don't need to worry about file ownership when sharing directories:</para>

<sect1 id="sect_03_05"><title>Summary</title>
<para>On UNIX, as on Linux, all entities are in some way or another presented to the system as files with the appropriate file properties.  Use of (predefined) paths allows the users and the system admin to find, read and manipulate files.</para>
<para>We've made our first steps toward becoming an expert: we discussed the real and the fake structure of the file system, and we know about the Linux file security model, as well as several other security precautions that are taken on every system by default.</para>
<para>The shell is the most important tool for interaction with the system.  We learned several shell commands in this chapter, which are listed in the table below.</para>
