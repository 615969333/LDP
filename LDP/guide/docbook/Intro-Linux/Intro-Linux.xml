<title>Why this guide?</title>

<para>Many people still believe that learning Linux is difficult, or that only experts can understand how a Linux system works.  Though there is a lot of free documentation available, the documentation is widely scattered on the Web, and often confusing, since it is usually oriented toward experienced UNIX or Linux users.   Today, thanks to the advancements in development, Linux has grown in popularity both at home and at work.  The goal of this guide is to show people of all ages that Linux can be simple and fun, and used for all kinds of purposes.</para>

<title>Who should read this book?</title>

<para>
This guide was created as an overview of the Linux Operating System, geared toward new users as an exploration tour and getting started guide, with exercises at the end of each chapter.  For more advanced trainees it can be a desktop reference, and a collection of the base knowledge needed to proceed with system and network administration.  This book contains many real life examples derived from the author's experience as a Linux system and network administrator, trainer and consultant.  We hope these examples will help you to get a better understanding of the Linux system and that you feel encouraged to try out things on your own.</para>
<para>Everybody who wants to get a CLUE, a Command Line User Experience, with Linux (and UNIX in general) will find this book useful.</para>

Many thanks to all the people who shared their experiences.  And especially to the Belgian Linux users, among them my husband, for hearing me out every day and always being generous in their comments.</para>
<para>Also a special thought for Tabatha Persad for doing a really thorough revision, spell check and styling, and to Eugene Crosser for marking the errors that we two looked over.</para>
<para>And thanks to all the readers who helped to pick out the last errors, unclear definitions and typos by going through the trouble of mailing me all their remarks.</para>
