<title>Why this guide?</title>

<para>Many people still believe that learning Linux is difficult, or that only
experts can understand how a Linux system works.  Though there is a lot of free
documentation available, the documentation is widely scattered on the Web, and
often confusing, since it is usually oriented toward experienced UNIX or Linux
users.   Today, thanks to the advancements in development, Linux has grown in
popularity both at home and at work.  The goal of this guide is to show people
of all ages that Linux can be simple and fun, and used for all kinds of purposes.

<section id="intro_02">
<title>Who should read this book?</title>

<para>
This guide was created as an overview of the Linux Operating System, geared
toward new users as an exploration tour and getting started guide, with
exercises at the end of each chapter.  For more advanced trainees it can be a
desktop reference, and a collection of the base knowledge needed to proceed with
system and network administration.  This book contains many real life examples
derived from the author's experience as a Linux system and network
administrator, trainer and consultant.  We hope these examples will help you
to get a better understanding of the Linux system and that you feel encouraged
to try out things on your own.
</para>
<para>Everybody who wants to get a CLUE, a Command Line User Experience, with
Linux (and UNIX in general) will find this book useful.

<title>Contributions</title>

<para>
Many thanks to all the people who shared their experiences.  And especially to
the Belgian Linux users, among them my husband, for hearing me out every day
and always being generous in their comments.
</para>
<para>Also a special thought for Tabatha Marshall for doing a really thorough
revision, spell check and styling, and to Eugene Crosser for marking the errors 
that we two looked over.
</para>
<para>And thanks to all the readers who noticed me about missing topics and who 
helped to pick out the last errors, unclear definitions and typos by going
through the trouble of mailing me all their remarks.
</para>
<para>Finally, a big thank you for the volunteers who are currently translating 
this document in French, Swedish, German and more.  It is a big work that should
not be underestimated; I admire your courage.

<title>Organization of this document</title>

<para>This guide aims to be the foundation for all other materials that you 
can get from The Linux Documentation Project.  As such, it provides you with 
the fundamental knowledge needed by anyone who wants to start working with a 
Linux system, while at the same time it tries to consciously avoid to re-invent 
the hot water.  Thus, you can expect this book to be incomplete and full of 
links to sources of additional information on your system, on the Internet and 
in your system documentation.
</para>
<para>The first chapter is an introduction to the subject on Linux; the next 
two discuss absolute basic commands.  Chapters 4 and 5 discuss some more 
advanced but still basic topics.  Chapter 6 is needed for continuing with the 
rest, since it discusses editing files, an ability you need to pass from Linux 
newbie to Linux user.  The following chapters discuss somewhat more advanced 
topics that you will have to deal with in everyday Linux use.
</para>
<para>All chapters come with exercises that will test your preparedness for the 
next chapter.</para>
