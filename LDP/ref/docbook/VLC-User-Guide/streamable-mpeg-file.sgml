<para>
Vls can stream MPEG 1 or MPEG 2 files that meet two
critera :
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>the file must be MPEG <emphasis>PS</emphasis>
(Program Stream) or MPEG <emphasis>TS</emphasis> (Transport Stream),
that contain video and audio multiplexed. Vls cannot stream MPEG
<emphasis>ES</emphasis> (Elementary Stream), i.e. a file with only audio
or video.</para>

<para>In order to know if an MPEG file is MPEG <emphasis>PS</emphasis>,
MPEG <emphasis>TS</emphasis> or MPEG <emphasis>ES</emphasis>, read the
file with vlc and look at the messages (select in the menu
<emphasis>View / Messages</emphasis>, or use the command line
<command>vlc -v</command>) and look for a
line :</para>

<programlisting>
module: locking demux module `mpeg_XX'
</programlisting>

<para>If <emphasis>XX = ps</emphasis> or <emphasis>XX =
ts</emphasis>, then your file is MPEG <emphasis>PS</emphasis> and
MPEG <emphasis>TS</emphasis> respectively, and you may be able to
stream it. If <emphasis>XX = es</emphasis>, then your file is MPEG
<emphasis>ES</emphasis> and is not streamable.</para>

<listitem><para>the sequence header of the video must repeat itself regularly,
which is often the case with MPEG 2, but very rare with MPEG 1. There is
no easy way to know if the sequence header is repeated regularly. Files
with a <emphasis>.vob</emphasis> extension are normally MPEG
2 files and files with <emphasis>.mpg</emphasis> or
<emphasis>.mpeg</emphasis> extension or
usually 
MPEG 1 files.</para>
