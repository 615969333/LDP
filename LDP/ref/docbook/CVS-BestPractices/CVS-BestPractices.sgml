<para>This article outlines some of the best practices that can be adopted
when &CVS; is used as the configuration management tool in your software
project.  </para>


<para>&CVS; (&CVSAB;) is an <ulink
url="http://www.opensource.org">&OPENSOURCE;</ulink> configuration management
tool that is now being looked at seriously by many commercial organizations as
a viable alternative to other commercial &SCM; tools.  </para>

<para>This spotlight on &CVSAB; has led to the inevitable question of best
practices for deploying &CVSAB; as the backbone &SCMAB; tool for large
software development projects.  Having answered this question many times
verbally as a bunch of <quote>gotchas</quote> on &CVSAB;, it was time to put
down on paper some of the best practices that I have adopted while managing
&CVSAB; based projects.  </para>

<!-- Using GUI Tools -->

<sect1 id="section1-guitools"> 
<title>Using GUI Tools</title> 

<para> Developers typically use integrated development environments that have
the CM tools integrated into them.  These tools minimize the learning for the
developers about the intricacies of &CVSAB; usage and instead allow them to be
productive from day one.  Developers who are accustomed to other CM tools will
find the &CVSAB; command-line interface daunting.  The adoption and usage of
&CVSAB; can be improved by using GUI tools for &CVSAB; clients.  GUI tools for
&CVSAB; are available at <ulink url="www.cvsgui.org">www.cvsgui.org</ulink>.
GUI interfaces are available for most of the popular platforms (Windows, Mac
and Linux).  In addition, on the Windows platform there is a SCC extension
that allows integration of &CVSAB; as the configuration control tool with
popular IDE.</para>

</sect1> 

<sect1 id="section1-devsandbox">
<title>Developer Sandbox</title>

<para>The developer <quote>sandbox</quote> is where each developer keeps his
or her working copy of the code base.  This is where they build, test and
debug the modules that they are working on.  A sandbox can also be the area
where the staging build or the production build is done.  Changes made in
the work area are checked into the &CVSAB; repository.  In addition, changes
made in the repository by others have to be updated in the sandbox on a
regular basis.  </para>

<para>The best practices related to developers sandbox are:
</para>
<sect2 id="section2-dontshare">
<title>Do not share the sandbox</title>

<para>Sandboxes have to be unique for each developer or purpose.  They should
not be used for multiple things at the same time.  A sandbox can be a working
area for a developer or the build area for the final release.  If such
workspaces are shared, then the developers themselves will not be aware of the
changes made to the files resulting in confusion.  </para>

<para>In &CVSAB;, the sandbox is created automatically when a working copy is
checked out for a &CVSAB; project using the <command>cvs checkout
{project-name}</command> command.  </para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="section2-workinside">
<title>Do not work outside the sandbox</title>


<para>The sandbox can be thought of as a controlled area within which
&CVSAB; can track for changes made to the various source files.  Files
belonging to other developers can be automatically updated by &CVSAB;.  Thus
the developer who lives within the sandbox will stand to gain a lot of
benefits of concurrent development that cannot be done if work is done
outside a sandbox.  </para> </sect2>

<sect2 id="section2-syncup">
<title>Stay in Sync with the repository</title>


<para>To gain the benefits of working within a sandbox as mentioned above,
the developer must keep his or her workspace in sync with the main
repository.  A regular <command>cvs update</command> with the appropriate
tag will ensure that the sandboxes are kept up to date.  </para> </sect2>

<sect2 id="section2-checkin">
<title>Check-in Often</title>

<para>To help other developers keep their code in sync with your code, you
must check-in your code often into the &CVSAB; repository.  As soon as a
piece of code is completed and tested, check-in the changes using a
<command>cvs commit</command> to ensure that your changes are committed to
the &CVSAB; repository.  </para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="section1-branchmerge"> 
<title>Branching and Merging</title> 

<para> Branching in &CVSAB; splits a project's development into separate,
parallel histories.  Changes made on one branch do not affect the other
branches.  Branching can be used extensively to maintain multiple versions
of a product for providing support and new features.  </para>

<para> Merging converges the branches back to the main trunk.  In a merge,
CVS calculates the changes made on the branch between the point where it
diverged from the trunk and the branch's tip (its most recent state), then
applies those differences to the project at the tip of the trunk.  </para> 

<sect2 id="section2-branchowner">
<title>Assign Ownership to Trunk and Branches</title>

<para>The main trunk of the source tree and the various branches should have a
owner assigned who will be responsible for.  </para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Establish a working policy for the branch or trunk.
</para>

<para>The owner will establish policies for check-in and check-out.  The
policy will define when the code can be checked in (after coding or after
review etc.,).  Who is responsible to merge changes on the same file and
resolve conflicts (the author or the person who recently changed the file).
</para>

</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Identify and document policy deviations
</para>

<para>Policies once established tend to have exceptions.  The owner will be
responsible for identifying the workaround and tracking/documenting the same
for future use.  </para>

</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Responsible for merge with the trunk
</para>

<para>The branch owner will be responsible for ensuring that the changes in
the branch can be successfully merged with the main trunk at a reasonable point
in time. </para>

</listitem>
</orderedlist>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="section2-tagrelease"> <title>Tag each release</title> <para>After
each release, the entire code base must be tagged with an identifier that
can help in uniquely identifying the release.  A tag gives a label to the
collection of revisions represented by one developer's working copy
(usually, that working copy is completely up to date so the tag name is
attached to the <quote>latest and greatest</quote> revisions in the
repository).  </para> 

<para>The identifier for the tag should provide enough information to
identify the release at any point in time in the future.  One suggested tag
identifier is of the form.  </para>

<literallayout>
	<literal>release_</literal>{major version #}_{minor version #}
</literallayout>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="section2-branchatrelease">
<title>Create a branch after each release</title>

<para>After each software release, once the &CVSAB; repository is tagged, a
branch has to be immediately created.  This branch will serve as the bug fix
branch for that release.  This branch is created only if the release is not
a bug fix or patch release.  Patches that have to be made for this release
at any point in time in the future will be developed on this branch.  The
main trunk will be used for ongoing product development.  </para>

<para>With this arrangement, the changes in the code for the ongoing
development will be on the main trunk and the branch will provide a separate
partition for hot fixes and bug fix releases.  </para>

<para>The identifier for the branch name can be of the form.  </para>

<literallayout>
<literal>release_</literal>{major version #}_{minor version #}<literal>_patches</literal>
</literallayout>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="section2-bugfixbranches">
<title>Make bug fixes to branches only</title>

<para>This practice extends from the previous practice of creating a
separate branch after a major release.  The branch will serve as the code
base for all bug fixes and patch release that have to be made.  Thus, there
is a separate repository <quote>sandbox</quote> where the hot fixes and
patches can be developed apart from the mainstream development. </para>

<para>This practice also ensures that bug fixes done to previous releases do
not mysteriously affect the mainstream version.   In addition, new features
added to the mainstream version do not creep into the patch release
accidentally.  </para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="section2-patchesfrombranches">
<title>Make patch release from branches only</title>

<para>Since all the bug fixes for a given release are done on its
corresponding branch, the patch releases are made from the branch.  This
ensures that there is no confusion on the feature set that is released as
part of the patch release.  </para>

<para>After the patch release is made, the branch has to be tagged using the
release tagging practice (see <xref linkend="section2-tagrelease">).  </para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="section1-chgpropagation">
<title>Change Propagation</title>
<para>Change propagation practices explores how changes made to one version of
the application are migrated to other living versions of the application.
</para>

<sect2 id="section2-mergebugfix">
<title>Merge branch with the trunk after release</title>

<para>After each release from a branch, the changes made to the branch should
be merged with the trunk.  This ensures that all the bug fixes made to the
patch release are properly incorporated into future releases of the
application.  </para>

<para>This merge could potentially be time consuming depending on the amount
of changes made to the trunk and the branch being merged.  In fact, it will
probably result in a lot of conflicts in &CVSAB; resulting in manual merges.
After the merge, the trunk code base must be tested to verify that the
application is in proper working order.  This must be kept in mind while
preparing the project schedule.  </para>

</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="section1-softwarebuild">
<title>Software Builds</title>

<para>This section deals with the best practices for software builds.  Build
is the process of creating the application binaries for a software release.
They are done in a periodic manner in  development teams to provide baseline
binaries for daily work.  </para>


<sect2 id="section2-bebo">
<title>Build Early and Build Often (<acronym>BEBO</acronym>) </title>

<para>A slight variation of this adage has been around in the &OPENSOURCE;
community called "Release Early and Release Often" for quite some time albeit
for a different reason.  BEBO helps a development team identify issues that
can arise from checking in the wrong files.  BEBO will address
integration issues at the application level that might have slipped
passed individual developer builds.  It will also improve the team morale when
they see a working version of the application.</para>

<para>Builds must be done on a regular basis.  There should be a dedicated
resource(s) assigned to do the same.  The entire project team must be trained
to view the daily build as an important activity and not as a chore.  Builds
must be completed without any failures on a regular basis.  Build failures
must be a rare event and should be treated with utmost seriousness.  The
project team should ensure that successful builds are top priority on their
agenda.  The seriousness can be emphasised by setting up a penalty for
breaking the build.  </para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="section2-automate">
<title>Automate Build Process completely</title>

<para>Another key practice for software builds is to automate the build
process completely.  The automation process must also include automatic
retrieval of the right source files from the &CVSAB; repository.  This
ensures that the build process is completely repeatable and consistent.  In
addition, the chances of a build with the wrong version of the application
source files are reduced to a large degree.  </para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="section2-ensurecheckin">
<title>All necessary files must be checked before build</title>

<para>This adage sounds trivial at first but this problem is very common
even with experienced development teams due to oversight.  The problem of
oversight cannot be easily addressed since the onus is on the individual
developer to ensure that his or her file has been checked in.  This practice
should be drummed into the team in the form of trainings and pre-build
announcements to ensure that the right version of source code is available
in the repository.  </para>

<para>Automated build process as explained above will help in catching this
problem to a certain degree since they will automatically take the source code
from the &CVSAB; repository and perform the software build.  Any missed items
will surface during the build process itself (makefiles etc.,) or during the
regression testing of the product (older version of the file checked in).
</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="section1-instprocess">
<title>Institutionalize &CVSAB; in the Organization</title>

<para>Here we will look at the best practices for institutionalizing &CVSAB;
usage in the organization.
</para>

<sect2 id="section2-chngmgmt">
<title>Implement Change Management Process</title>

<para>All organizations must implement a good Change management process
(<acronym>CMP</acronym>).  A good CMP will define how changes are received and
recorded, tracked, executed and delivered.  &CVSAB; provides version control
for your project.  Change management addresses the <quote>bigger
picture</quote> of how enhancements and bugs are received, tracked and
closed.  &CVSAB; will play a smaller but a very important part in this
entire picture.  With a formal change management process in place in
the organization, tools such as &CVSAB; will be looked at as aiding
this process instead of acting as a general development overhead.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="section2-objectives">
<title>Make &CVSAB; Usage part of Objectives</title>

<para>To institutionalize &CVSAB;, it can be made as part of the annual
objectives for the developer to use it as part of his or her project.  In addition,
it can also be made as part of the objective for the project manager to deploy
&CVSAB; in his or her project.  </para>

<para>Compliance of this can then be reviewed as part of the appraisal cycle
for the employee.  </para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="section2-metrics">
<title>Collect metrics on &CVSAB; usage</title>

<para>&CVSAB; usage metrics can be collected in terms of percentage of
deployment in the organization,  project size handled etc., This information
will spur other line managers and program managers to look at &CVSAB; as a
tool that will aid them in their daily operations.
</para>

</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="section1-conclusion">
<title>Conclusion</title>

<para>These best practices are meant to help software teams get a head start
on using &CVSAB; for their development.  The ideas presented here have to be
constantly reviewed and evolved.  I would like this to be a growing and
evolving document.  Please send your comments and ideas to
