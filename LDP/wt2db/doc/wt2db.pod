=head1 NAME

B<wt2db> - utility to convert WikiText documents into DocBook XML.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<wt2db> [I<OPTION>] [I<FILE>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<wt2db> converts a text file in a special format similar to that used
in WikiWikiWebs into valid DocBook XML.

By default it reads from STDIN and writes to STDOUT. However, if given a
filename, it will read that file, and an output filename can also be
specified.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<-o>, B<--output-to> I<filename> write to the specified file.

B<-v>, B<--verbose> show diagnostic output.

B<-h>, B<--help> show a usage message.

=head1 BUGS

None currently known. Please report bugs to the author at
<david@lupercalia.net>.

=head1 RESTRICTIONS

Currently only a single form of WikiText is supported, which is very
similar to that used by the Wikipedia (see http://www.wikipedia.com).
A future release will be configurable to support additional styles of
WikiText.

=head1 NOTES

B<wt2db> was developed as a project of the Linux Documentation Project
to create an easier way of writing DocBook documentation. While it is
useful on its own, it is part of Lampadas, the LDP's document
production system.
