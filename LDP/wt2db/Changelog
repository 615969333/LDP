2002-05-01	0.3	Initial public release.

2002-05-24	0.4	Added -a, --article option.
            This option wraps the document content in <article>
            tags, and prefixes the file with a DocBook 4.1.2
            DOCTYPE declaration.

            Added <articleinfo> as a literal section, so a user
            can write their own meta-data when not using
            Lampadas and still get a complete DocBook file.

CVS         Switched -V and -v, now -v is version, -V is verbose.
            Changed -a, --article to -x, --xml and -s, --sgml to
            let you pick your own doctype.

            Added -n, --nonet parameter to disable network
            lookups.

            Fixed bug in screen blocks, para tags were being
            closed when not open.

            Deleted [ for <filename>, added [[file:]] namespace instead.
            This is less likely to generate false positives.
            
            [[ is now for internal links and become <xref>.

            Encoding of literal block tags into entities.

            Added -e, --encoding to specify encoding.            

            Added [[dir:foo]] for directories.

            Added [[dev:foo]] for device files.

            Added ability to nest ordered lists and itemized lists
            up to four levels deep, mix-and-match.

            "#" and "*" for lists no longer have to be in the first column.

            Added XML ISO Entity reference.
