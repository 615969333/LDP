2002-05-01	0.3	Initial public release.

2002-05-24	0.4	Added -a, --article option.
			This option wraps the document content in <article>
			tags, and prefixes the file with a DocBook 4.1.2
			DOCTYPE declaration.

			Added <articleinfo> as a literal section, so a user
			can write their own meta-data when not using
			Lampadas and still get a complete DocBook file.

CVS			Switched -V and -v, now -v is version, -V is verbose.
			Changed -a, --article to -x, --xml and -s, --sgml to
			let you pick your own doctype.

			Added -n, --nonet parameter to disable network
			lookups.

			Fixed bug in screen blocks, para tags were being
			closed when not open.

			Deleted [ for <filename>, added [[file: namespace.
			
			[[ is now for internal links and become <xref>.

            Encoding of literal block tags into entities.

            Added -e, --encoding to specify encoding.
