<para>
This is the list of Frequently Asked Questions for Linux, the free,
POSIX compatible operating system kernel that runs on many modern
computer systems.  Linux uses free, GNU system utilities and
application software, although commercial programs are available also.
Originally written for 386/486/586 Intel/ISA bus machines, Linux
versions exist for Alpha, Sparc, MIPS, ARM, 680x0, PPC, and many other
platforms.  (Please refer to the question, ``<xref
linkend="what-is-linux" endterm="what-is-linux">'' below.) This FAQ is meant
to be read in conjunction with the Linux Documentation Project's HOWTO
series.  (``<xref linkend="get-linux-material-by-ftp"
endterm="get-linux-material-by-ftp">'' and, ``<xref
linkend="howtos-and-other-documentation"
endterm="howtos-and-other-documentation">'') The
<citetitle>INFO-SHEET</citetitle> and <citetitle>META-FAQ</citetitle>
also list sources of Linux information.  Please read them, and,
``<xref linkend="still-havent-answered"
endterm="still-havent-answered">'' before posting to a Usenet news
group.  You can also get Postscript, HTML, and SGML versions of this

<para>
Linux is the kernel of operating systems that look like and perform as
well or better than the famous operating system from AT&amp;T Bell Labs.
Linus Torvalds and a loosely knit team of volunteer hackers from
across the Internet wrote (and still are writing) Linux from scratch.
It has all of the features of a modern, fully fledged operating
system: true multitasking, virtual memory, shared libraries, demand
loading, shared, copy-on-write executables, proper memory management,
and TCP/IP networking.
</para>
<para>
Most people, however, refer to the operating system kernel, system
software, and application software, collectively, as "Linux," and
that convention is used in this FAQ as well.
</para>
<para>
Linux was written originally for 386/486/586-based PC's, using the
hardware facilities of the 80386 processor family to implement its
features. There are now many ports to other hardware platforms.
(``<xref linkend="what-ports-to-other-processors-are-there"

handheld platforms.  An API specification and developers kit for the
Crusoe Smart Microprocessor developed by Transmeta Corporation are at

Some distributions can still be installed via anonymous FTP from
various Linux archive sites, but in many cases, the size of the
distribution makes this impractical.  (``<xref

is to the ARM610 of the Acorn RISC PC. The RISC PC port is currently
in its early to middle stages, owing to the need to rewrite much of
the memory handling. The A5000 port is in restricted beta testing. A
release is likely soon.

How Much Hard Disk Space Does Linux Need?</title>
<para>
About 10Mb for a very minimal installation, suitable for trying Linux,
and not much else.
</para>
<para>
You can fit an installation that includes X into 80Mb. Installing
Debian GNU/Linux takes 500Mb&ndash;1GB, including kernel source code, some
space for user files, and spool areas.
</para>
<para>
Installing a commercial distribution that has a desktop GUI
environment, commercial word processor, and front-office productivity
suite, will claim 1&ndash;1.5 GB of disk space, approximately.

<sect2 label="1.7">
<title id="how-much-memory-does-linux-need">
How Much Memory Does Linux Need?</title>
<para>
At least 4MB, and then you will need to use special installation
procedures until the disk swap space is installed. Linux will run
comfortably in 4MB of RAM, although running GUI apps is impractically
slow because they need to swap out to disk.
</para>
<para>
Some applications, like StarOffice, require 32 MB of physical memory,
and compiling C++ code can easily consume over 100 MB of combined
physical and virtual memory.

How Much Memory Can Linux Use?</title>
<para>
A number of people have asked how to address more than 64 MB of
memory, which is the default upper limit in most standard
kernels. Either type, at the <literal>BOOT lilo:</literal> prompt:
</para>
<para>
<screen>
mem=XXM
</screen>

<para>
Or place the following in your <filename>/etc/lilo.conf</filename>
file:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>
append="mem=XXM"
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
The parameter ``<emphasis>XX</emphasis>M'' is the amount of memory,
specified as megabytes; for example, ``128M.'' 
</para>
<para>
If an ``<literal>append=</literal>'' directive with other
configuration options already exists in
<filename>/etc/lilo.conf</filename>, then add the
<literal>mem=</literal> directive to the end of the existing
argument, and separated from the previous arguments by a space; e.g.:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>
# Example only; do not use.
append="parport=0x3bc,none serial=0x3f8,4 mem=XXM"
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
Be sure to run the ``<command>lilo</command>'' command to install the
new configuration.
</para>
<para>
If Linux still doesn't recognize the extra memory, the kernel may
need additional configuration.  Refer to the
<filename>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/memory.txt</filename> file in
the kernel source as a start.

How Is the DocBook Version of the FAQ Produced?</title>
<para>
At present, the Linux FAQ uses the OASIS DocBook SGML DTD.  HTML
output is produced using James Clark's <application>Jade</application>
DSSSL parser with modified versions of Norman Walsh's modular style
sheets.  Question numbers are generated with Perl.  The text version
is formatted from HTML with <application>lynx</application>, and split
into segments using the standard GNU text utilities, and the segments
are posted to Usenet.  The DocBook utilities are located at

Where Can I Get the Latest Kernel Version?</title>
<para>
Make that versions. The 2.0. series kernels are still available for
older machines. Following Linus's even/odd versioning scheme, the
latest production kernel is 2.2.x. The updates to this kernel are bug
fixes. Active development is proceeding on the 2.3.x versions of the
kernel, and a feature freeze has recently been announced for the 2.4
series production kernels.
</para>
<para>
Linux kernel version 2.2. was released on January 25, and a bug fix
version 2.2.1 was released several days later. New versions are always
being released. The kernel contains numerous improvements in features
and performance compared to the kernel versions 2.0.x.
</para>
<para>
Among the 2.2 kernel's many improvements are a video frame buffer,
faster (although bigger) memory management, support for more hardware
devices, improved security, and improved POSIX compatibility. The
Linux kernel, in many of these instances, is superior to commercial
OS's.
</para>

unofficial, draft press releases are located at

If you want to download the source code, FTP to ftp.xx.kernel.org,
where "xx" is the two-letter Internet domain abbreviation of your
country; e.g., "us" for United States, "ca" for Canada, or "de" for
Germany. Kernel versions 2.2.x are archived in the directory
<filename>pub/linux/kernel/v2.2</filename>, 
as are patches for the prerelease versions. The
kernel source code is archived as a <literal>.tar.gz</literal> 
file, and as a <literal>.tar.bz2</literal> file.
</para>
<para>
Follow the instructions in any of the standard references to compile
the 2.2 kernel, as you would with any other custom kernel. The
Documentation subdirectory also contains information by the authors of
various subsystems and drivers, and much of that information is not
documented elsewhere.
</para>
<para>
If you want to participate in kernel development, the latest 2.3
version kernels are available from ftp.kernel.org as well. Make sure
you sign on to the linux-kernel mailing list to find out what people
are working on.

Remember that Linux is POSIX compatible, and most all of the material
in the <citetitle>comp.unix.*</citetitle> and 
<citetitle>comp.windows.x.*</citetitle> groups will be relevant. Apart
from hardware considerations, and some obscure or very technical
low-level issues, you'll find that these groups are good places to
start.

<title id="can-linux-share-my-disk-with-dos">
Can Linux Share My Disk with DOS? OS/2? 386BSD? Win95?</title>
<para>
Yes. Linux uses the standard MS-DOS partitioning scheme, so it can
share your disk with other operating systems. Note, however, that many
other operating systems may not be exactly compatible. DOS's
<filename>FDISK.EXE</filename> and <filename>FORMAT.EXE</filename>,
for example, can overwrite data in a Linux partition, because they
sometimes incorrectly use partition data from the partition's boot
sector rather than the partition table.
</para>
<para>
In order to prevent programs from doing this, it is a good idea to
zero out--under Linux--the start of a partition you created, before
you use MS-DOS--or whatever--to format it. Type:
</para>
<para>
<screen>
   $ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdXY bs=512 count=1
</screen>
</para>
<para>
where <emphasis>hdXY</emphasis> is the relevant partition; e.g.,
<filename>/dev/hda1</filename> for the first partition of the first
(IDE) disk.
</para>
<para>
Linux can read and write the files on your DOS and OS/2 FAT partitions
and floppies using either the DOS file system type built into the
kernel or mtools. There is kernel support for the VFAT file system
used by Windows 9x and Windows NT.

How Do I Add Temporary Swap Space?</title>
<para>
In addition to a swap partition, Linux can also use a swap file. Some
programs, like <application>g++</application>, can use huge amounts of 
virtual memory, requiring
the temporary creation of extra space. To install an extra 64 MB of
swap space, for example, use the following shell commands:
</para>
<para><screen>
   # dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap bs=1024 count=65535
   # mkswap /swap
   # swapon /swap
</screen></para>
<para>
The <command>count=</command> argument to <command>dd</command> 
determines how big the swap file will be. In
this example the swap file's name is <filename>/swap</filename>, 
but the name and
location are, generally, arbitrary, depending only on the file
system's available space and your having write permissions in the
directory.
</para>
<para>
When you don't need the swap space any more, remove it with the
following statements:
</para>
<para><screen>
   # swapoff /swap
   # rm /swap
</screen></para>

How Do I Remove LILO So My System Boots DOS Again?</title>
<para>
The <command>lilo</command> program (not the complete

line option <command>-u</command> to uninstall the 
<application>LILO</application> boot loader. You have to supply
the device name of the device you installed 
<application>LILO</application> on, for example:
</para>
<para><screen>
   lilo -u /dev/hda
</screen></para>
<para>
This rewrites the original, pre-<application>LILO</application> 
master boot record back to the
first hard drive, from the boot record saved in

you installed <application>LILO</application> to a partition 
as a secondary boot loader, for
example, <filename>/dev/hda1</filename>, <command>lilo</command> 
re-installs the original boot sector from the
save file <filename>/boot/boot.0301</filename>. 
Refer to the <command>lilo</command> manual page for details.
Thanks to Villy Kruse for reminding me to update this answer.
</para>
<para>
If you have an earlier version of <application>LILO</application>, you
will have to use the DOS (MS-DOS 5.0 or later, or OS/2) <literal>FDISK
/MBR</literal> (which is not documented).  This will restore a
standard <application>MS-DOS</application> Master Boot Record. If you
have <application>DR-DOS 6.0</application>, go into
<filename>FDISK.EXE</filename> in the normal way and then select the
<literal>Re-write Master Boot Record</literal> option.
</para>
<para>
If you don't have MS-DOS or DR-DOS, you need to have the boot sector
that LILO saved when you first installed
it. You did keep that file, didn't you?  It's probably called
<filename>boot.0301</filename> or some such. Type:
</para>
<para><screen>
   dd if=boot.0301 of=/dev/hda bs=445 count=1
</screen></para>
<para>
(or <filename>/dev/sda</filename> if you're using a SCSI disk). 
This may also wipe out your
partition table, so beware! If you're desperate, you could use
</para>
<para><screen>
   dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1
</screen></para>

This will erase your partition table and boot sector completely: you
can then reformat the disk using your favorite software. But this will

How Do I Upgrade the Libraries without Trashing My System?</title>
<warning><para>
Note: You should always have a rescue disk set ready when you perform
this procedure, in the likely event that something goes wrong!
</para></warning>
<para>
This procedure is especially difficult if you're upgrading very old
libraries like <application>libc4</application>. But you should be 
able to keep <application>libc4</application> on the same
system with <application>libc5</application> libraries for the 
programs that still need them. The
same holds true for upgrading from <application>libc5</application> to 
the newer-yet <application>glibc2</application> libraries.
</para>
<para>
The problem with upgrading dynamic libraries is that, the moment you
remove the old libraries, the utilities that you need to upgrade to
the new version of the libraries don't work. There are ways around
around this. One is to temporarily place a spare copy of the run time
libraries, which are in <filename>/lib/</filename>, in 
<filename>/usr/lib/</filename>, or <filename>/usr/local/lib/</filename>, 
or another directory that is listed in the 
<filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename> file.
</para>
<para>
For example, when upgrading <application>libc5</application> libraries, 
the files in <filename>/lib/</filename> might
look something like:
</para>
<para><screen>
   libc.so.5
   libc.so.5.4.33
   libm.so.5
   libm.so.5.0.9
</screen></para>
<para>
These are the C libraries and the math libraries. Copy them to another
directory that is listed in <filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename>, 
like <filename>/usr/lib/</filename>:
</para>
<para><screen>
   $ cp -df /lib/libc.so.5* /usr/lib/
   $ cp -df /lib/libm.so.5* /usr/lib/
   $ ldconfig
</screen></para>
<para>
Be sure to run <command>ldconfig</command> 
to upgrade the library configuration.
</para>
<para>
The files <filename>libc.so.5</filename> and <filename>libm.so.5</filename>
are symbolic links to the actual
library files. When you upgrade, the new links will not be created if
the old links are still there, unless you use the <command>-f</command>
flag with <command>cp</command>. The
<command>-d</command> flag to <command>cp</command> will copy the 
symbolic link itself, and not the file it points to.
</para>
<para>
If you need to overwrite the link to the library directly, use the 
<command>-f</command> flag with <command>ln</command>.
</para>
<para>
For example, to copy new libraries over the old ones, try this. Make a
symbolic link to the new libraries first, then copy both the libraries
and the links to <filename>/lib/</filename>, with the following commands.
</para>
<para><screen>
   $ ln -sf ./libm.so.5.0.48 libm.so.5
   $ ln -sf ./libc.so.5.0.48 libc.so.5
   $ cp -df libm.so.5* /lib
   $ cp -df libc.so.5* /lib
</screen></para>
<para>
Again, remember to run <command>ldconfig</command> after you copy 
the libraries.

If you are satisfied that everything is working correctly, you can
remove the temporary copies of the old libraries from 
<filename>/usr/lib/</filename> or wherever you copied them.

With an <acronym>ELF</acronym> compiler

I Upgraded the Kernel and Now My PCMCIA Card Doesn't Work.</title>
<para>
The PCMCIA Card Services modules, which are located in
<filename>/lib/modules/</filename><emphasis>version</emphasis><filename>/pcmcia</filename>,
where <emphasis>version</emphasis> is the version number of the
kernel, use configuration information that is specific to that kernel
image only. The PCMCIA modules on your system will not work with a
different kernel image. You need to upgrade the PCMCIA card modules
when you upgrade the kernel.
</para>
<para>
When upgrading from older kernels, make sure that you have the most recent
version of the run-time libraries, the modutils package, and so on.
Refer to the file <filename>Documentation/Changes</filename> 
in the kernel source tree for details.
</para>
<para>
Important: If you use the PCMCIA Card Services, do not enable the
<literal>Network device support/Pocket and portable adapters</literal>
option of the kernel configuration menu, as this conflicts with the
modules in Card Services.
</para>
<para>
Knowing the PCMCIA module dependencies of the old kernel is useful.
You need to keep track of them. For example, if your PCMCIA card
depends on the serial port character device being installed as a
module for the old kernel, then you need to ensure that the serial
module is available for the new kernel and PCMCIA modules as well.
</para>
<para>
The procedure described here is somewhat kludgey, but it is much easier
than re-calculating module dependencies from scratch, and making sure
the upgrade modules get loaded so that both the non-PCMCIA and PCMCIA
are happy. Recent kernel releases contain a myriad of module options,
too many to keep track of easily. These steps use the existing module
dependencies as much as possible, instead of requiring you to
calculate new ones.
</para>
<para>
However, this procedure does not take into account instances where
module dependencies are incompatible from one kernel version to
another. In these cases, you'll need to load the modules yourself with
insmod, or adjust the module dependencies in the
<filename>/etc/conf.modules</filename> file. The
<filename>Documentation/modules.txt</filename> file in the kernel
source tree contains a good description of how to use the kernel
loadable modules and the module utilities like
<command>insmod</command>, <command>modprobe</command>, and
<command>depmod</command>.  <filename>Modules.txt</filename> also
contains a recommended procedure for determining which features to
include in a resident kernel, and which to build as modules.
</para>
<para>
Essentially, you need to follow these steps when you install a new
kernel.
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para> Before building the new kernel, make a record with
the <command>lsmod</command> command of the module dependencies that
your system currently uses. For example, part of the
<command>lsmod</command> output might look like this:

<para><screen>

   memory_cs          2            0
   ds                 2    [memory_cs]     3

This tells you for example that the <filename>memory_cs</filename> 
module needs the ds

What it doesn't say is that,
in order to avoid recalculating the module dependencies, you may
also need to have the <filename>serial</filename>, 
<filename>lp</filename>, <filename>psaux</filename>, and other standard
modules available to prevent errors when installing the pcmcia
routines at boot time with <command>insmod</command>. 
A glance at the <filename>/etc/modules</filename> file will tell
you what modules the system currently loads, and in what order.
Save a copy of this file for future reference, until you have
successfully installed the new kernel's modules. Also save the 
<command>lsmod</command>
output to a file, for example, with the command:
<command>lsmod >lsmod.old-kernel.output</command>.

<filename>/sbin/cardctl</filename> to
<filename>/sbin/cardmgr.old</filename> and
<filename>/sbin/cardctl.old</filename>. The old versions of these
utilities are not compatible with the replacement utilities that Card
Services installs. In case something goes awry with the installation,
the old utilities won't be overwritten, and you can revert to the
older versions if necessary. When configuring Card Services with the
``<literal>make config</literal>'' command, make sure that the build
scripts know where to locate the kernel configuration, either by using
information from the running kernel, or telling the build process
where the source tree of the new kernel is. The ``<literal>make
config</literal>'' step should complete without errors. Installing the
modules from the Card Services package places them in the directory
<filename>/lib/modules/</filename><emphasis>version</emphasis><filename>/pcmcia</filename>,

loaded at boot time,
and compare it with the module listing that the old kernel loaded,

Locate the chat script that PPP will use to dial the modem and connect
to your ISP. In many systems, this is either in the
<filename>/etc/chatscripts</filename> or <filename>/etc/ppp</filename>
directory, and will be called <filename>provider</filename> or
something similar.  You can store a <literal>chat</literal> script
anywhere, provided that you tell <command>pppd</command> to use it
rather than the default script. Refer to the <command>chat</command>
and <command>pppd</command> manual pages, and the information below,
for details.  Here is a sample <literal>chat</literal> script:
</para>
<para><screen>
   ABORT        BUSY
   ABORT        "NO CARRIER"
   ABORT        VOICE

   word         &lt;your_password&gt;
</screen></para>
<para>
This is a <command>chat</command> 
program for a simple, script based login. The <command>chat</command>
program uses the pair of strings on each line as a match/response
pair. When it starts, it sends the string
``ATDT<emphasis>your_isp's_phone_number</emphasis>,'' 
where you have substituted the
actual phone number of course. It then waits for the string
<literal>ogin</literal> 
(a substring of the word <literal>login</literal>) and sends your user
name. It then waits for <literal>word</literal> 
(a substring of <literal>password</literal>) and sends
your password. If your ISP uses a different login and password
prompts, and any additional prompts, you will need to edit the
script accordingly. Again, refer to the <command>chat</command> 
manual page for details.
</para>
<para>
If your ISP uses PAP or CHAP authentication, you will need to edit the
<filename>pap-secrets</filename> or <filename>chap-secrets</filename>

manual pages for these files, as well as the instruction in the files
themselves.  </para></listitem> <listitem><para> The configuration of
<command>pppd</command>, the program that maintains the actual
connection, is usually contained in two or three separate files.  The
first is usually <filename>/etc/ppp/options</filename>, which contains
options that all of your system's PPP connections will use. (Yes, you
can have more than one; as many as your computer has serial ports,
generally.)

<para>
The options may be given on one line or each on a separate line.
Many options files are much longer, and come with a description of
each option. Here, the options mean, in order, don't remap any
characters between the PPP client and server; always use password,
PAP, or CHAP authentication when making a connection; use the
modem's hardware handshake lines for flow control; lock the serial
port when in use so no other programs can access it; and do not
use the IPX network protocol.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
For connection set-up on each individual serial port or PPP host,
there will either be an <filename>/etc/ppp/options.ttyS1</filename>, 
for example,
options file for <filename>/etc/ttyS1</filename>, or a file for 
your ISP in the <filename>/etc/ppp/peers</filename> directory. 
The default is often called
<filename>/etc/ppp/peers/provider</filename>. Here is a sample 
of the default <filename>provider</filename>
file:
</para>
<para><screen>

   connect "/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/chatscripts/provider"
   defaultroute
   /dev/ttyS1
   38400

</screen></para>
<para>
There might be an explanation of these and other options in the
<filename>/etc/ppp/peers/provider</filename> file itself. You 
can also refer to the
<command>pppd</command> manual page for details. 
Briefly, they mean: do not use PAP
authentication for this connection; use the <command>chat</command> 
program and the
<filename>/etc/chatscripts/provider</filename> script, which is 
described above, to
dial the phone and log in; set the network default route to the
PPP connection (so when your network software needs to resolve an
network address that is not on your local machine(s), it will use
the PPP connection to the Internet); use <filename>/dev/ttyS1</filename> 
as the serial
port for the connection; set the modem speed to 38400; and keep
the <command>pppd</command> daemon running even if the connection fails.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
That is all of the configuration you need. To actually start and
stop PPP, there are often <filename>/usr/bin/pon</filename> and 
<filename>/usr/bin/poff</filename> scripts
(in Debian), or something similar, and they are usually very simple,
and only contain the command:
</para>
<para><screen>
   $ /usr/sbin/pppd call ${1:-provider}
</screen></para>
<para>
This will start <command>pppd</command> and use the 
<literal>call</literal> option to call the
server that you type on the command line, or the provider given in
the <filename>/etc/ppp/peers/provider</filename> file if you 
do not specify a remote
server. After making the call and logging in (about 30 seconds),
you should be able to use the <filename>/sbin/ifconfig</filename> 
program to determine
that the connection really did establish a PPP interface (the
first will be <filename>ppp0</filename>, the second will be 
<filename>ppp1</filename>, etc., depending on
how many simultaneous PPP connections you have. If something goes
wrong, you can look at the <filename>/var/log/ppp.log</filename> 
file to determine what
happened. You can also view the log as the connection is being
made, by ``tailing'' it in another window; that is, viewing it as
pppd logs the connection's status information. To do this, use the
command (again, as root):
</para>
<para><screen>
   $ tail -f /var/log/ppp.log
</screen></para>
<para>
On some systems the PPP output is directed to 
<filename>/var/log/messages</filename>, in which case your system
may not have a dedicated PPP log file.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>    
<para>
You should be also able to <command>ping</command> 
one of your ISP's domain names
(e.g., <literal>mail.isp.com</literal>) and receive a response.
</para>
<para>
These are the most basic steps for configuring a PPP connection. You
will also need to take into account what other network connections may
be present (for example, if there's an Ethernet connection that has
already been assigned the default route), as well as various security
measures at your ISP's end. If you're having trouble making the
dial-up connection, usually the best way to determine what may be
going wrong is to use Seyon, minicomm, kermit, or some other program to dial
and log in manually to the ISP, and determine just exactly what you
have to do to log in, then duplicate that in the PPP scripts.

<literal>.gz</literal> (and <literal>.z</literal>) files

<para>
<literal>.taz</literal>, <literal>.tar.Z</literal>, and
<literal>.tz</literal> are <emphasis>tar</emphasis> files (made with

<command>compress</command>.  The standard *nix
<command>compress</command> is proprietary software, but free

If you find that <command>gzip</command> complains when you try to
uncompress a file, you probably downloaded it in ASCII mode by

How Many People Use Linux?</title>
<para>
Linux is freely available, and no one is required to register with any
central authority, so it is difficult to know. Several businesses
survive solely on selling and supporting Linux. Linux news groups are
some of the most heavily read on Usenet. Accurate numbers are hard to
come by, but the number is almost certainly in the millions.
</para>
<para>
However, people can register as Linux users at the Linux Counter
project, which has been in existence since 1993. In August, 1998, the
project counted more than 70,000 users.
</para>
<para>
Visit the Web site at 
<ulink url="http://counter.li.org/">
<literal>http://counter.li.org/</literal></ulink> and fill in the
registration form. If you don't want to use the Web, send E-mail to
<ulink url="mailto:counter@counter.li.org">

subject line, ``<literal>I use Linux at home</literal>,'' or 
``<literal>I use Linux at work.</literal>''

This is a matter of religious debate, of course!

If you want to hear Linus himself say how he pronounces it, download

If you have a sound card or the PC-speaker audio driver you can hear
them by typing
</para>
<para><screen>
   $ cat english.au >/dev/audio
</screen></para>
<para>
The difference isn't in the pronunciation of Linux but in the language
Linus uses to say, ``hello.''
</para>
<para>
For the benefit of those who don't have the equipment or inclination:
Linus pronounces Linux approximately as Leenus, where the ``ee'' is
pronounced as in ``feet,'' but rather shorter, and the ``u'' is like a
much shorter version of the French ``eu'' sound in ``peur''
(pronouncing it as the ``u'' in ``put'' is probably passable).

The same is true for X terminal displays.  If your distribution

GCC says, ``<literal>Internal compiler error</literal>.''</title>
<para>
If the fault is repeatable (i.e., it always happens at the same place
in the same file--even after rebooting and trying again, using a
stable kernel) you have discovered a bug in GCC. See the GCC Info
documentation (type
<keycombo><keycap>F1</keycap><keycap>i</keycap></keycombo> in Emacs,
and select GCC from the menu) for details on how to report the
error--make sure you have the latest version, though.
</para>
<para>
Note that this is probably not a Linux-specific problem. Unless you
are compiling a program many other Linux users also compile, you
should not post your bug report to any of the comp.os.linux groups.
</para>

If the problem is not repeatable, you may be experiencing memory
corruption--see

<sect2 label="10.6">
<title id="make-says">
Make Says, ``<literal>Error 139.</literal>''</title>
<para>
Your compiler (GCC) dumped core. You probably have a corrupted, buggy,

you may be running out of swap space--see 
(``<xref linkend="machine-runs-very-slowly-when"

</para>

If this doesn't fix the problem, you are probably having problems with
memory or disk corruption. Check that the clock rate, wait states, and
refresh timing for your SIMMS and cache are correct (hardware manuals
are sometimes wrong, too). If so, you may have some marginal SIMMS, or
a faulty motherboard or hard disk or controller.

Yes. Linux uses XFree86 (the current version is 4.0, which is based
on X11R6). You need to have a video card which is supported by
XFree86. See the <citetitle>XFree86 HOWTO</citetitle> for more details.

Most Linux distributions nowadays come with an X installation.
However, you can install or upgrade your own, from
<ulink url="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/Xfree86-*">

How Do I Get the X Window System to Work?</title>
<para>
The answers to this question can, and do, fill entire books. If the
installation program wasn't able to configure the X server correctly,
Linux will most likely try to start the X display, fail, and drop back
into text-only terminal mode.
</para>
<para>
First and foremost, make certain that you have provided, as closely as
possible, the correct information to the installation program of your
video hardware: the video card and monitor. Some installation programs
can correctly guess a ``least common denominator'' screen configuration,
like a 640-by-480 VESA-standard display, but there are many possible
video hardware configurations that may not be able to display this
standard.
</para>
<para>
The X Window System configuration file is called (usually)
<filename>/etc/XF86Config</filename>, 
<filename>/etc/X11/XF86Config</filename>, or
<filename>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config</filename>.
</para>
<para>
If you need to manually configure the X server, there are several
possible methods:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
Try to use the <command>XF86Setup</command> program, which 
can help identify the
correct X server and monitor timings for the video hardware.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
Make sure that the X server has the correct options. If you log in
as the superuser, you should be able to use 
<literal>X --probeonly</literal> to
get a listing of the video card chipset, memory, and any special
graphics features. Also, refer to the manual page for the X
server. (E.g.; <literal>man X</literal>) Also, try running 
the X server and redirecting the standard error output to a file so you can
determine what error messages the server is generating; e.g., 
<literal>X 2>x.error</literal>.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
With that information, you should be able to safely refer to one
of the references provided by the Linux Documentation Project. 
("Where can I get the HOWTO's and other documentation? ")
There are several HOWTO's on the subject, including a HOWTO to
calculate video timings manually if necessary. Also, the

has a chapter with a step-by-step guide to writing a 
<filename>XF86Config</filename> file.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>    
<para>
Also, make sure that the problem really is an incorrect 
<filename>XF86Config</filename>
file, not something else like the window manager failing to start. If
the X server is working correctly, you should be able to move the
mouse cursor on the screen, and pressing 
<keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>Backspace</keycap></keycombo> will shut
down the X server and return to the shell prompt in one of the virtual
terminals.

to the <citetitle>XFree86 HOWTO</citetitle>, recent versions of 
<citetitle>Installation and
Getting Started</citetitle>, and the instructions for the 
<filename>XF86Setup</filename> program.

The contents of the <filename>XF86Config</filename> file 
depend on the your exact
combination of video card and monitor. It can either be configured by
hand, or using the <command>XF86Setup</command> utility. 
Read the instructions that came
with XFree86, in <filename>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/etc</filename>. 
The file you probably need to
look at most is <filename>README.Config</filename>.

You should not use the sample <filename>XF86Config.eg</filename> 
file which is included
with newer versions of XFree86 verbatim, because the wrong video clock
settings can damage your monitor.

Please don't post to <citetitle>comp.os.linux.x</citetitle>

you post to the appropriate <citetitle>comp.os.linux.*</citetitle> 
newsgroup. Make sure you
read the next question first. "( What to put in a request for
help. )"

What to Put in a Request for Help.</title>
<para>
Please read the following advice carefully about how to write your
posting or E-mail. Making a complete posting will greatly increase the
chances that an expert or fellow user reading it will have enough
information and motivation to reply.
</para>
<para>
This advice applies both to postings asking for advice and to personal
E-mail sent to experts and fellow users.
</para>
<para>
Make sure you give full details of the problem, including:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
What program, exactly, you are having problems with. Include the
version number if known and say where you got it. Many standard
commands tell you their version number if you give them a
<literal>--version</literal> option.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
Which Linux release you're using (Red Hat, Slackware, Debian, or
whatever) and what version of that release.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
The exact and complete text of any error messages printed.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
Exactly what behavior you expected, and exactly what behavior you
observed. A transcript of an example session is a good way to show
this.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
The contents of any configuration files used by the program in
question and any related programs.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
What version of the kernel and shared libraries you have
installed. The kernel version can be found by typing 
``<literal>uname -a</literal>,'' and
the shared library version by typing 
``<literal>ls -l /lib/libc*</literal>.''
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
Details of what hardware you're running on, if it seems
appropriate.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>    
<para>
You are in little danger of making your posting too long unless you
include large chunks of source code or uuencoded files, so err on the
side of giving too much information.
</para>
<para>
Use a clear, detailed Subject line. Don't put things like ``doesn't
work,'' ``Linux,'' ``help,'' or ``question'' in it--we already know that.
Save the space for the name of the program, a fragment of an error
message, or summary of the unusual behavior.
</para>
<para>
Put a summary paragraph at the top of your posting.
</para>
<para>
At the bottom of your posting, ask for responses by email and say
you'll post a summary. Back this up by using 
``<literal>Followup-To: poster</literal>.''
Then, actually post the summary in a few days or a week or so. Don't
just concatenate the replies you got--summarize. Putting the word
``SUMMARY'' in your summary's Subject line is also a good idea. Consider
submitting the summary to <citetitle>comp.os.linux.announce</citetitle>.
</para>
<para>
Make sure your posting doesn't have an inappropriate References:
header line. This marks your article as part of the thread of the
article referred to, which will often cause it to be junked by
readers, along with the rest of a boring thread.
</para>
<para>
You might like to say in your posting that you've read this FAQ and
the appropriate HOWTO's--this may make people less likely to skip your
posting.
</para>
<para>
Remember that you should not post E-mail sent to you personally without
the sender's permission.

<para>
Try to find the author or developer of whatever program or component
is causing you difficulty. If you have a contact point for your Linux
distribution, you should use it.
</para>
<para>
Please put everything in your E-mail message that you would put in a
posting asking for help.
</para>
<para>
Finally, remember that, despite the fact that most of the Linux
community are very helpful and responsive to E-mailed questions,
you're likely asking for help from unpaid volunteers, so you have no
right to expect an answer.
