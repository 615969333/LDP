<sect> Introduction

<sect1> Preamble <p>

Linux Quake sits at the crossroads of two computing revolutions - GNU/Linux,
the popular free operating system, and GLQuake, the first "first person
shooter" to use the 3D graphics library OpenGL.  Quake has a loyal community
still making games almost ten years  after it's release by ID Software, and
thanks to John Carmack releasing the software under the GPL, people are able to
enjoy it on non-proprietary platforms.
<newline> <newline>
Does all this mean our game is important ?  No...  It's just fun ;-)

<sect1> About <p>

This document is not an exhaustive how-to about setting up any one Quake
program, but a modern guide to GLQuake, a collection of the most useful tips,
and a pointer to the best resources still available on the web.
It concentrates on the many engine rewrites and incredible add-ons which make
Quake the phenomena it is.

<sect> General Info

<sect1> Getting Started <p>

Installing Quake requires a few basic steps.

<descrip>

<tag/Get the Game Data Files/

Getting the game data files is normally done by installing the game using
Microsoft Windows, or an emulator such as Wine or Dosbox, and then
copying the <bf>id1</bf> directory of the installed game to your Linux Quake
directory (making sure all files are in <ref id="lowercase_" name="lowercase">).

Alternatively, if you have the DOS Quake CD, you can use the
<url url="http://freshmeat.net/projects/lhaforunix/" name="lha utility">
to extract the data files.  For early CDs, you must first
<code>    cat /mnt/cdrom/quake101.1 /mnt/cdrom/quake101.2 > resource.1</code>
Once you have the resource.1 file, then type
<code>
    cd /usr/local/games/quake
    lha e {some directory}/resource.1
</code>

Later versions of the game, including WinQuake, come with the data files in an
uncompressed form and the <bf>id1</bf> directory can be directly copied from
the CD.  


<tag/Install a Quake Executable/

The program you execute to run Quake is known as the
<ref id="engine_" name="game engine">. There are several to choose from, but
the simplest choice is either Jörgen's <ref id="glquake_" name="GLQuake">, or
the author's <url url="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/uhexen2/tyr-glquake?download" name="patched TyrQuake">.
After downloading or compiling a game engine, place
this binary in your Quake directory alongside the <bf>id1</bf> directory.

<tag/Summary/

Finally, you should have a directory structure similar to this, with all files
being in <ref id="lowercase_" name="lowercase">:

<verb>
/usr/local/games/quake +- glquake.glx (or another game engine)
                       |
                       +- id1 -+- config.cfg
                               |
                               +- game.dat
                               |
                               +- pak0.pak
                               |
                               +- pak1.pak
</verb>
Now, from an xterm window, type (for example)
<code>    ./glquake.glx -fullscreen -width 800 -height 600</code>
to start the game.


<tag/Help/

This sounds simple, but if you are new to Linux and you are not familiar
with the command line, try one of these links for more information:

</itemize>

</descrip>

<sect1> Command Line Options <p>

Command Line Options are extra parameters that are typed on the Linux command
line following the program's name.  Quake has a large number of them, some of
which vary from engine to engine.  The most useful/common ones are:

<descrip>
	<tag/-window/Run the game in windowed mode
	<tag/-fullscreen/Run the game in fullscreen mode
	<tag/-game NAME/Load the mod NAME.
	<tag/-mem N/Reserve N megabytes of memory for the internal heap.  This 
	generally defaults to 8 or 16 meg, but must be increased when playing
	larger mods.
	<tag/-width WIDTH/window/fullscreen width
	<tag/-height HEIGHT/window/fullscreen height
	<tag/-sndspeed MHz/Set sound sampling rate (eg. 44100, 22100, 11025)
	<tag/-sndbits N/Set sound bits to N = 8 or 16
	<tag/-nosound/Disable sound. Necessary when sound is
	absent/unconfigured to stop the game from crashing.
	<tag/-nomtex/Disable GL multitextures.
	<tag/-listen N/Allow a maximum of N players/bots to join multiplayer games.
	<tag/-cddev DEVICE/Use DEVICE for playing the cd music
	<tag/-nocdaudio/Disable cd audio
</descrip>
	
You can also append Quake commands to the Linux command line by prefixing
them with a plus sign. For example, to automatically start a new game
at hard skill, use
<code>    glquake.glx +skill 2 +map e1m1</code>

<sect1> Game Console Commands <p>

<em>For more info see <url url="http://www.planetquake.com/console/commands/quake.html"></em>

The console is an in-game command line at which you can issue commands,
change variables and cheat. It is toggled by pressing the tilde "&tilde;" key when
in a game. The main commands include -

<descrip>

<tag/god/Invulnerability
<tag/noclip/Walk through walls
<tag/notarget/Enemies won't attack player
<tag/timedemo DEMO/Play DEMO (eg. "demo1") at top speed and show frame rate
<tag/impulse N/Issue "impulse N" 

These are in-game commands which can be given special uses. The most 
common cheat is <bf>impulse  9</bf> which gives all weapons.
<tag/bind key "COMMAND"/Bind a key to perform a command
<tag/map MAP/Load MAP
<tag/changelevel MAP/Load MAP without resetting player settings
<tag/quit/Exit to system
<tag/skill	VALUE/value = 0 (easy) - 3 (impossible)

Degree of difficulty. Level must be restarted to take effect
<tag/r_wateralpha	VALUE/value = 0.0 - 1.0

Opacity of water 
<tag/_snd_mixahead 	VALUE/value = 0.1 - 1.0

Raising this value is a good way to speed up the game at the expense of
some sound lag. I use 0.3
<tag/r_shadows	FLAG/flag = 0 | 1

Display model shadows
<tag/vid_wait	FLAG/flag = 0 | 1

Sync video output with screen refresh
<tag/chase_active	FLAG/flag = 0 | 1

Show player from third person perspective

<sect> Game Engines <label id="engine_"> <p>

<sect1> GLQuake <label id="glquake_"> <p>

The first place for Linux noobs to go is Jörgen's no frills site. Here you'll
find some relevant documentation and trouble shooting tips, and a basic
version of OpenGL Quake for Linux.  Fairly pain free by Linux standards, it
supports most Quake mods, but gamma (brightness) support is broken.

<url url="http://mfcn.ilo.de/glxquake">

<label id="darkplaces_">

<sect1> Darkplaces <p>

Darkplaces is an amazing Quake engine with a great range of visual
enhancements and options for colour, effects and sound. It uses the same Doom3
lighting features as Tenebrae and thus requires a more powerful computer than
GLQuake and QuakeForge.

It also supports many otherwise incompatible mods including <ref id="nehahra_"
name="Nehahra"> and <ref id="nexuiz_" name="Nexuiz">, and has improved support
for the official mission packs.

Havoc's <url url="http://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/files/"
name="file archive"> can be a little confusing.  The large "gameengine2005"
tarballs include precompiled binaries and the game's source code in a second
tarball. To compile your own program uncompress the second tarball
, type <bf>make</bf> to see a list of possible targets (programs), and select
one. For example - to build the OpenGL engine with ALSA sound type <bf>make
cl-release</bf>, or to build with OSS sound, <bf>make cl-release
DP_SOUND_API=OSS</bf>.

Much thanks to Lord Havoc for this great project.

<url url="http://www.icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces">

<label id="qudos_">

<sect1> QuDos Quake Ports <p>

"Here you'll find QuDos' `linuxified` src+bin tarballs for popular quake ports,
including that of bjp for Nehahra."

This is great news for gamers. For the first time these engines - including
DemonQuake, JoeQuake, NehQuake, Qrack and Tremor - have been ported to Linux.
<url url="http://qudos.quakedev.com/linux/quake1/NehQuake-bjp-bin-src.linux.tar.bz2"
name="NehQuake"> runs <ref id="nehahra_" name="Nehahra"> much faster than
Darkplaces, and <url url="http://qudos.quakedev.com/linux/quake1/JoeQuake-v0.15b1146-bin-src.linux.tar.bz2" name="JoeQuake"> has impressive eye candy.

The tarballs include source code, binaries and in most cases the data
files necessary for the engine.  To install these data files, find the simply
named folders (such as "joequake" or "qrack") inside the tarballs and move them
to your quake directory. If they are not present you will have to download them
from the game's homepage.

For some of the engines, an additional sound library (which is included)
has to be installed. To do this:
<code>
    su
    cd /usr/lib
    mv {some directory}/libfmod-3.74.1.so .
    ln -s libfmod-3.74.1.so libfmod.so
    ldconfig
</code>
or visit the <url url="http://www.fmod.org" name="FMOD homepage"> and install the
libraries manually.


<url url="http://qudos.quakedev.com/linux/quake1">

<label id="quakeforge_">

<sect1> QuakeForge <p>

QF is the most comprehensive Linux Quake project. It has a visually enhanced engine,
numerous single player and <ref id="quakeworld_" name="QuakeWorld"> clients and
Quake C tools. Amongst it's features are:
an overhauled menuing sytem, a new "heads up display", and in-game help.

Possibly because of it's size, QuakeForge hasn't been updated in years
and it's documentation was never quite finished.
The usual "configure && make && make install" will build the whole project, but
to make a single player binary only, try:
<code>
    configure --with-static-plugins --without-tools --without-servers --with-clients=glx
    zcat <ruamoko/cl_menu/menu.dat.gz >{somedir}/quake/id1/menu.dat
</code>

For information about building QuakeForge on the BSD Unices, see the <ref
id="freebsd_" name="FreeBSD"> section.

Kudos to the QuakeForge team for a huge project which has provided much inspiration
for other open source games.

<url url="http://www.quakeforge.net">

<url url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/quake/"> 

<label id="tyrquake_">

<sect1> TyrQuake <p>

Is a fairly complete project including Quake and Quakeworld 
clients and <url url="http://disenchant.net/utils.html" name="other tools">
 including the popular TyrLite. Tyrann's focus is on a fully featured
but miminalist engine for Windows and Linux. 

To compile TyrQuake-0.47, first edit the makefile and select a few options.
(The single player client is "NQ").  Nvidia users may have to apply <url
url="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/uhexen2/tyrquake-0.47-nvidia.patch?download"
name="this patch"> to fix a few bugs. Versions after 0.47 should build
without this.

A patched TyrQuake single player binary is available
<url url="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/uhexen2/tyr-glquake?download" name="here">.


<url url="http://disenchant.net/engine.html">

<sect1> Software Quake <p>

<em>For a more in-depth treatment of Software Quake, see the  <ref id="old_" name="previous version"> of this how-to</em>.

The <url url="http://www.quakeforge.net/files/q1source.zip" name="original
WinQuake source"> also came with two pixelated versions of the game:

<itemize>
<item> X Quake (quake.x11)
<item> Svga Quake (squake)
</itemize>
		
but compiling them is no longer straight forward. It involves copying
<bf>Makefile.linux</bf> to <bf>Makefile</bf>, editing this file to remove the extra
targets , replacing <bf>/usr/X11/lib</bf> with <bf>/usr/X11R6/lib</bf> and typing
<bf>make build_release</bf>.

There are easier options though. <ref id="tyrquake_" name="TyrQuake">
and <ref id="quakeforge_" name="QuakeForge"> have software clients, and there is
also an old <url url="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/quake/" name="SDL Quake">
written by SDL's author, Sam Lantinga, which should work on all modern platforms.

<sect1> Other <p>

<label id="nprquake_">

<sect2> NPRQuake <p>

Another Quake engine which has been ported to Linux but afaik hasn't been
touched in a few years is <url url="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/graphics/Gallery/NPRQuake/" name="NPRQuake">.
Notably, it has the ability to load different renderers on the fly (!) which
is pretty cool. The <url url="http://www.geocities.com/coolguywithgun" name="linux port"> includes support for the cartoon renderer
<url url="http://www.cs.unc.edu/%7Eadyilie/comp238/Final/Final.htm" name="ainpr">,
and works really well for me.

The <url url="http://www.tempestgames.com/ryan/" name="SDL version">
has rewritten mouse and video code and may work on otherwise troublesome
systems. But the sound APIs have not been ported to SDL, so it
is not a truly portable engine.

<sect2> Tenebrae <p>

A Quake engine using advanced lighting techniques similar
to those in Doom III. Requires a very fast computer to run and may not be compatible with all hardware.

<url url="http://tenebrae.sourceforge.net/">

<sect2> Twilight Project <p>

The <url url="http://icculus.org/twilight" name="Twilight Project">
"is a set of rather minimalist NQ and QW engines that focus on insane rendering
speed, it is however a bit unstable at the moment."

<!-- horizontalline -->

<sect> Mods

<sect1> Mods <p>

There are hundreds of user created levels - known variously as "mods", "total
conversions" or simply "maps", all over the internet. When it comes to
finding them though, many URLs are no longer valid, and it is easier to just
google for a file name (perhaps adding "quake" as an extra search term) than
to try and find the project's homepage - which is probably just dust in the
ether now.

To run new maps, place the bsp file into the "quake/id1/maps"
subdirectory, and start Quake with the <bf>+map MAPNAME</bf> option.

Installing mods is simply a matter of creating a subdirectory DIR and
extracting the contents of the mod zipfile/tarball into this directory.
It is then loaded by using the <bf>-game DIR</bf> command line option and,
sometimes, <bf>+map MAPNAME</bf> where MAPNAME is the mod's start map. 

For both maps and mods, all files should be in <ref id="lowercase_" name="lowercase"> format.


QuakeTerminus has a good 
<url url="http://www.quaketerminus.com/addon.htm" name="list"> of mods,
and
Tenfour numerous <url url="http://tenfourmaps.telefragged.com/php/revidx.php?gameid=q1&amp;sortby=date&amp;reversesort=1&amp;page=1" name="map reviews">.

A few of the author's favourites are:

<descrip>

<tag/Soul of Evil/
Soul of Evil is a gorgeous medieval themed mod with two single player
episodes, a melee style arena mode and nice documentation.  Many thanks to
Tronwyn, Fat Controller and their co-authors.
<url url="http://www.planetquake.com/tronyn/soul" name="Link">

<label id="nehahra_"><tag/Nehahra/
Epic. Ambitious. Otherwordly.
Nehahra is the definitive Quake mod, supported in Linux by LordHavoc's
<ref id="darkplaces_" name="Darkplaces">, and <ref id="qudos_" name="QuDos">'
port of the NehQuake engine. It has some great models and maps, uses fog effects well, and has an
(optional) two hour movie/demo which ties-in well with the original Quake
"story-line" but is also in desperate need of an edit.
<url url="http://www.planetquake.com/nehahra" name="Link">

<tag/Contract Revoked/
A modern mod which made my jaw drop. It also has ambitious sequels: The Lost
Chapters and Quoth.
<url url="http://kell.spawnpoint.org/convoked.html" name="Link">

<tag/The Masque of the Red Death/
A vast, recently released castle map, which also requires Darkplaces and
<em>fast</em> hardware.  "Monster Count: 404 on Hard" - Tronwyn.
<url url="http://www.fileplanet.com/dl.aspx?/planetquake/tronyn/maps/masque.zip" name="Link">

<tag/The Hunted Chronicles/
Another game requiring the Darkplaces engine, the Hunted Chronicles is a 
zombie shooter/survival mod in two parts. The second uses fog
and lighting effects to spooky effect, and could almost be mistaken for a
Half-Life mod.
<url url="http://www.ru1337.com/" name="Link">

<tag/Neil Manke's mods/
Neil wrote the definitive Half-Life mod "They Hunger".
The quality and fun is in these maps too -

<url url="http://www.planethalflife.com/manke/" name="Link">

<tag/Blood Mage/
... is a dungeons and dragons themed mod with great monsters and music. It's a
little dated now, and the numerous spells can be overwhelming -
<url url="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=bmfull.zip" name="bmfull.zip">

<tag/Operation: Urth Majik/
Oum is one of the few Quake 1 mods with a sci-fi feel. It's a well made five
level mod with cut-scenes and many new weapons -
<url url="http://disenchant.net/files/maps/oum.zip" name="oum.zip">,
<url url="http://www.planetquake.com/fatty/oum/" name="Link">

<tag/The Coagula Contest 2/
Coagula is a six level compendium of maps originating from a contest. The
novelty is that all maps are floating in the ether, and it's a great set.
<url url="http://www.planetquake.com/underworld/quakerev030814.html" name="Link">

<tag/Scourge done Slick/
SdS is a speed run through Mission Pack 1, Scourge of Armagon.  Hilarious and
amazing.

<tag/Insomnia/
Cracking game-play and rivers of blood -  
<url url="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=czg07.zip" name="czg07.zip">	

<tag/Zerstörer/
Dark and bloody, with Doom's paranoiac atmosphere - a classic.
Zerstörer also has some good death match levels -
<url url="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=zerstorer.zip" name="zerstorer.zip">

<tag/Fantasy Quake/ FQ is a traditional medieval themed conversion. The game
has some beautiful levels, but also plenty of raw edges as it was never quite
finished.  (The project ended prematurely when the web hosting hit a snag).
Not all the player classes work perfectly. Use the "g" key twice to purchase
items, the "<",">","/" keys for inventory, and the "w","e","r" keys for the
grappling hook - <url url="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=fantasy.zip"

<sect1> Commercial Mods <p>

<descrip>

<tag/Mission Pack 1/
Scourge of Armagon by Ritual Entertainment (formerly known as Hipnotic Interactive).

<tag/Mission Pack 2/
Dissolution of Eternity by Rogue Entertainment.
<newline><newline>
- Both official mission packs are generally acknowledged as better than the original game.

<tag/Malice/
Very original Quake total conversion, with the greatest
(make believe) machine gun I've ever unleashed.  Worth paying for.

<tag/Abyss of Pandemonium/
Commercial mod now freely available:
<url url="http://www.planetquake.com/impel" name="Link">

<tag/Ravages of Apocalypse/
Xmen mod! Great models. Shame about the game-play.  ...When good mods turn bad.
<newline>
This mod has now been released free of charge, and can be found
<url url="http://www.zerogravity.com.au/xmen/" name="here">.

<tag/Shrak/
One of the first commercial mods. It has well modelled and totally
new monsters, but the game-play doesn't cut it anymore.

</descrip>

<sect1> Mapping tools <p>

Another first for Quake was the implementation of it's own game language -
Quake C.  This enables mods to work seamlessly on any operating system.
It is possible to install many of the editors which are used to make Quake
maps, but creating full scale mods is real voodoo and beyond my knowledge.

<bf>GtkRadiant</bf>
is the only currently maintained world editor I know of
<url url="http://www.qeradiant.com/" name="Link">

The <bf>Quake Army Knife</bf> (QuArK) is a multi-purpose Quake editing tool which..

Quake sound effects.

<itemize>

<item> From the Linux command line, type <bf>killall artsd</bf>

the game will disable hardware dga mouse.

<newline><newline>

</itemize>

<tag/Game saves fail &sol; Options not remembered/If you are running Quake
as a normal user and experiencing these problems it's probably due to 
having insufficient privileges to write to the game directories. Solutions
include:

<itemize>

<item> Run the game as super user: Type <bf>su</bf> and enter root's
password before typing <bf>glquake.glx ...</bf> to start the game.

<newline><newline>

<item> Change the game file permissions. Unix operating systems have
strong security preventing unauthorised or accidental file changes.
The simplest way to overcome this in a single user environment is to become
super user and change ownership of the quake directory with (as root):
<bf>chown -R USERNAME /usr/local/games/quake</bf>. However it is
recommended users read the <bf>chmod</bf> and <bf>chown</bf> man
and info pages to better understand Unix file permissions.

<newline><newline>

<item> In full multi-user environments it is recommended using the
<ref id="darkplaces_" name="Darkplaces"> or 
<ref id="quakeforge_" name="QuakeForge"> game engines, which correctly
place per-user data in their home directory.

</itemize>

Quake uses a confusing method of saving and restoring game options, 
especially when playing add-ons, and game options sometimes have to be
reinitialised even though file permissions are not an issue.
In such cases, the author can offer no simple advice %-/.

<tag/Crazy polygons/
Some mission-packs/mods for Quake can cause existing player/monster models to
be drawn with lines all over the place. To fix this, delete the directory
"quake/id1/glquake".  When you next run the game, it will remake this directory
and everything should be fine.

<tag/Lines on screen/
A common problem with 3dfx cards is a shower of flickering lines on the screen.
		
<itemize>

<item> From the game console, type <bf>gl_ztrick 0</bf>.

</itemize>

<tag/Other graphical anomalies/

Some Quake engines use an OpenGL speed-up known as multitexturing.
This normally works fine, but if you are experiencing glitches
you can disable this feature with the <bf>-nomtex</bf> option.

Older video cards may occasionally draw models in all white.
See the PlanetQuake <url url="http://www.planetquake.com/console/commands/quake.html" 
name="command list"> for in-game GL variables to fine tune performance.

</descrip>

<sect1> Video Drivers <p>

Setting up hardware GL acceleration under Linux used to be a big deal, but
modern distros should now handle this automatically. Of course there are
exceptions...

Nvidia's drivers for all of their modern video cards are not open source.
Because of this many distributions do not include them. If your Nvidia card is
running slowly this is probably the cause and  you should visit <url
url="http://www.nvidia.com"> to download the Linux installer. In the author's
experience these drivers are great, but not all versions work 100% with all
cards. If you have a misbehaving Nvidia video card, try a different driver.

While new versions of XFree and Xorg have great support for Voodoo 3, 4 and 5,
early 3dfx hardware such as Voodoo1, Voodoo2 and Rush are no longer hardware
accelerated. To get OpenGL working for these cards, you'll need to download,
install and/or compile the software libraries called Glide and Mesa.
<url url="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=28982&amp;group_id=124987" name="Here">
is a detailed README on old 3dfx cards.

<sect1> Sound Drivers <label id="sound_"> <p>

There are two major Linux sound systems -
Open Sound System and ALSA.  If you are experiencing sound problems and
the trouble-shooting section hasn't helped, you
may consider changing the sound driver. This can be hard work, and is only
for experienced users.

To ascertain which driver you are currently using,
type <bf>lsmod</bf> to list currently loaded kernel modules. The ALSA sound
modules have verbose names starting with "snd_", while the OSS modules have
more terse names. For example, the ALSA Sound Blaster Live module is
"snd_emu10k1", while the OSS module is "emu10k1". Since Linux kernel 2.6, ALSA
has been the standard sound system, while 2.4 and earlier were more likely to
come with OSS sound.

Information about ALSA can be found at the
<url url="http://www.alsa-project.org" name="Alsa Homepage">
and Linux Journal's
<url url="http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/8234/print" name="Guide to ALSA">.

For those already with ALSA wishing to try the OSS modules, a 
<url url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO/" name="kernel recompile">
is probably necessary.

<sect> Quake Sequels <p>

<label id="hexenII_">

<sect1> Hexen II <p>
			  
Hexen II is a colourful adaption of the Quake engine, and in terms of
source code and theme is much closer than Quake II to the original
game. Unfortunately, <url url="http://ravensoft.com" name="Raven Software">
released the game with many rough edges... So beautiful, yet so cruel.

<url url="http://uhexen2.sourceforge.net" name="Hammer of Thyrion">
 is the main Linux Hexen II port , and has had much work
done towards squishing bugs and enhancing the OpenGL graphics.
While it is not as widely distributed as Quake, the HoT demo includes some
of the game's best levels and is available from the Sourceforge <url
url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/uhexen2" name="project page">.

<sect1> Quake II <label id="quakeII_"> <p>

Quake II is the sci-fi themed sequel to Quake.

Early Linux releases weren't very solid, especially the mouse handling, but there is now a few related projects to choose from.
<url url="http://qudos.quakedev.com/linux/quake2" name="QuDos' Quake II">
is the most recent, being based on 
<url url="http://www.icculus.org/quake2/" name="Icculus Quake II">, but having
an enhanced graphics engine.
Michael Olson has some Quake II
<url url="http://www.cs.odu.edu/~olson/linux/quake2-0.12-1jag.src.rpm" name="source">
and
<url url="http://www.cs.odu.edu/~olson/linux/quake2-0.12-1jag.i386.rpm"
name="binary"> rpms which appear to be old Icculus releases.
Alternatively, there is the <url
url="http://www.quakeforge.net/files/quake2forge/quake2-0.3.tar.gz"
name="QuakeForge Quake II"> project which also provides support for
multiple operating systems.

The multiplayer paintball mod <ref id="digitalpaint2_" name="Digital Paint 2">
is based on Quake II.

<em>See the <ref id="old_" name="old version"> of this how-to
for Quake II troubleshooting tips.</em>

<sect1> Quake III Arena <p>

The third Quake installment was a landmark multiplayer game, with some of the
most beautiful and well balanced fragging ever. It was one of the first games
to receive a full Linux commercial release.

Recently <url url="http://www.idsoftware.com" name="ID Software">
released the source code, and you'll find an
<url url="http://www.icculus.org/quake3/" name="Open Source Quake III"> project
at Icculus.org.

Most mods should work. The Linux Gamers FAQ reports:
<verb>
    Yes, ... modifications work in Linux as long as they are compiled to the
    Quake III ... VM bytecode as advised by id software.  ...  modifications
    compiled to Windows library files will not work.</verb>

The retail add-on Quake III Team Arena is supported and, despite never
getting rave reviews, is a great game.

<sect1> FreeBSD <p>

The author has limited experience with this OS and currently uses FreeBSD 5.3 with Nvidia's
proprietary drivers.  <ref id="darkplaces_" name="Darkplaces"> and <ref

For basic GLQuake support, you can find a hacked FreeBSD binary and source
tarball <url url="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=124987&amp;package_id=137465&amp;release_id=329290" name="here">.

<ref id="quakeforge_" name="QuakeForge"> is a comprehensive Quake project,
but may have installation issues with newer FreeBSD releases. The memory
allocator routine "alloca" is not correctly detected on FreeBSD 5.3. The fix
is, after running "configure", to add "#define C_ALLOCA 1" to
"include/config.h" and undefine other ALLOCA variables.  Another issue is the
opening of plugins. If the project builds, but you can't get the console or
menus, you may have to enable static plugins using <bf>configure
LDFLAGS=-lpthread --with-static-plugins</bf>.

	<newline> (by  Pathogen) <newline> 
	..... Quake was the first FPS to introduce realistic lighting and
	shadows.  Of course, this came at a price. Quake has taken a lot of
	flak because it's all dull brown and grey. This was necessary because
	it was the only way to get the lighting to work properly. Since each
	surface needs a wide variety of reserved colors for displaying
	darkened/brightened portions of the surface, the game was limited to
	just a few colors and all their respective shades.
	<newline> (by Ashley Pomeroy) <newline>
	Almost incidentally, Quake introduced the now-standard concept of a FPS
	"console", and popularised "mouselook" as *the* absolute standard
	control interface.  Although the specifications required a Pentium,
	Quake ran acceptably well on a 486 DX4/100

<newline><newline>

	<item> "Quake and its three follow up games, Quake II,Quake III Arena
	and Quake 4 (which many do not regard as true sequels), have sold over
	4 million copies combined.  In 2005, a version of Quake was produced
	for mobile phones."

<sect1> Glossary <p>

<descrip>

<tag/ALSA/ <url url="http://www.alsa-project.org" name="Advanced Linux Sound Architecture">.

<tag/API/Application Program Interface. The computer libraries
which are used when programming, and link the game to the hardware.

<tag/Bot/A computer generated player with artificial intelligence (cough), in
a multiplayer game. Used to play multiplayer when no-one's around or not
connected to a network.

<tag/Client/This word is used in two subtly different ways. In single player,
the Quake game is known as a client, with different clients using their own
graphics libraries (for example, the GL client "quake.glx" or the X11 client
"quake.x11"). The usage is similar in multiplayer games, but also means the
per-user program which connects to a single "server" program which lets all
the players exist in the same world.

<tag/FPS/First Person Shooter. A shooting game viewed from the "first person" perspective.

<tag/Mod/Modification to the original Quake game varying from a complete game
overhaul (total conversion) to simple map/model reworks.  Quake was designed to
allow for ease of platform portability with it's own computer language "Quake
C" giving mappers control over most every aspect of their Quake world.

<tag/Noob/Newbie. Someone new to a computer related topic.

<tag/Patch/A software patch (or diff) is a single file used to alter
a source code tree before compilation. It is often used to fix bugs or
add new features that the original author didn't include.

Usage of the GNU patch utility is of the form <bf>patch [--dry-run] -pNUM
&lt;FILE </bf> where NUM is the number (usually 0 or 1) of directories to
strip from the patch file. This number is not obvious except to unix gurus, but
using the "--dry-run" option will let you test run patch so you can find the
correct NUM. ...Using the wrong number will make patch output all sorts of
cryptic messages which can be terminated with a <bf>control-C</bf> character.

Of course you could always type <bf>man patch</bf> and learn for yourself
how to use this powerful unix command. ;-/

<tag/SDL/<url url="http://www.libsdl.org/" name="Simple DirectMedia Layer">
cross platform hardware API widley used in Linux games.

<tag/Server/A program central to multiplayer games to which every player connects.

<tag/Tarball/An archive file such as <bf>somefile.tar</bf> created by the
"tar" program.  It is often compressed using the programs
"gzip" or "bzip2", in which case it will normally end in the letters
<bf>.gz</bf> or <bf>.bz2</bf>. The extension <bf>.tar.gz</bf>
is often shortened to <bf>.tgz</bf>.
