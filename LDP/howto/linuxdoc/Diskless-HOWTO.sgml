This document describes how to set up a diskless Linux box. 
As technology is advancing rapidly, network-cards are becoming cheaper and much 
faster - 100 MBits ethernet is standard now and in about 1 to 2 years 
1000 MBits i.e. 1GigBits ethernet cards will become an industry standard.
With high-speed network cards, remote access will become as fast as the 
local disk access which will make diskless nodes a viable 
alternative to workstations in local LAN. Also diskless nodes eliminates the 
cost of software upgrades and system administration costs like backup, 
recovery which will be centralized on the server side. 
Diskless nodes also enable "sharing/optimization" of centralised server CPU,
memory, hard-disk, tape and cdrom resources. Diskless nodes 
provides mobility for the users i.e., users
can log on from any one of diskless nodes and are not tied to one workstation.
Diskless Linux box completely eliminates the need for local floppy disk, 
cdrom drive, tape drive and hard-disk. Diskless nodes JUST has a network card,
8MB RAM, a low-end cpu and a very simple mother-board which does not have 
any interface sockets/slots for harddisks, modem, cdrom, floppy etc..
With Diskless linux nodes you can run programs on remote Linux 64 CPU SMP box 
or even on Linux super-computer!
Diskless nodes lowers the "Total Cost of Ownership" of the computer system.

<sect> Buying is cheaper than building!
<p>
Sometimes, buying a diskless linux computer will be cheaper than building!!
Checkout the following commercial sites, which are selling diskless 
linux network-cards and diskless computers. These companies do <bf>mass
production</bf> of Linux Diskless computers selling millions of units and thereby 
reducing the cost per unit. Each and every fortune 1000 companies in USA will be
replacing the MS Windows PCs with diskless computers in near future as diskless
linux computers can run both Linux and MS Windows 95 programs (via 
VMWare BIOS software). <url name="VMWare" url="http://www.vmware.com"> is NOT a 
emulator but has BIOS which allows you to install Windows 98/NT as 
guest OS to linux. You can use the 'xhost' command and DISPLAY environment from
diskless node to run Windows95/Linux programs. See 'man xhost' on linux.
You can also use Virtual Network Computing (VNC) to run Windows95/NT programs on
linux diskless nodes. Get VNC from <url url="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc">

<chapt> Advantages of Diskless Computer
-->
<sect> Advantages of Diskless Computer
<p>
Diskless linux computer will become <bf>immensely</bf> popular and will 
be the product of this century and in the next century.
The diskless linux computers will be very successful because of the
availability of very high-speed network cards at 
very low prices. Today 100 Megabit 
per second (12.5 MB per sec transfer rate) network cards are 
common and in about 1 to 2 years 1000 MBit (125 MB per sec transfer rate)
network cards will become very cheap and will be the standard.

In near future, Monitor manufacturers will place 
the CPU, NIC, RAM <bf>right inside</bf> the monitor to form 
a diskless computer!!
This eliminates the diskless computer box and saves space. The monitor will
have outlet for mouse, keyboard, network RJ45 and power supply.

The following are benefits of using diskless computers -
<itemize>
<item> Diskless Linux computers can run BOTH MS Windows 95/NT and linux programs.
<p>
<item> Total cost of ownership is very low in case of Diskless computers. 
Total cost of ownership is cost of initial purchasing + cost of maintainence.
The cost of maintainence is usually <bf>3 to 5 times</bf> the cost of 
initial computer purchase and this cost is recurring year after year.
In case of Diskless computers, the cost of maintainence 
is <bf>completely eliminated</bf>!!
<p>
<item> All the backups are centralized at one single main server.
<p>
<item> More security of data as it is located at server.
<p>
<item> No need of UPS battery, air-conditioning, dust proof environment for 
diskless clients, only server needs UPS battery, A/C and dust proof environment.
<p>
<item> Noise is completely eliminated since diskless computer does not have
Fan motor, and local harddisk. Only server makes lots of noise but it is enclosed 
in a server room. 
<p>
<item> Protection from Virus attack - Computer virus cannot attack diskless
computers as they do not have any hard disk. Virus cannot do any damage to
diskless computers. Only one single server box 
need to be protected against virus attack. This saves millions of dollars for 
the company by avoiding installtion of vaccines and cleaning the hard disks!!
<p>
<item> Server can have large powerful/high performance hard disks, can optimize
the usage of disk space via sharing by many diskless computer users. 
Fault tolerance of hard disk failure is possible by using RAID on main server.
<p>
<item> Server can have 64 bit CPU SMP box having many CPUs or even 
linux super-computers. CPU power can be shared by many diskless computer users
<p>
<item> Sharing of central server RAM memory by many diskless computer users.
For example, if many users are using web browser than at server RAM there will
be only one copy of web browser in the RAM. In case Windows 95 PCs, many 
users need to have individual copy of web browser 
in local RAM and hence there is wastage of RAM space.
<p>
<item> Diskless computers are extremely fast because program loading time is
completely eliminated. For example, if the server loads the StarOffice suite
into memory due to request from one diskless user then if another diskless user wants to
use the StarOffice suite then loading time is avoided since StarOffice is 
already loaded.
<p>
<item> Diskless linux computers can run programs on multiple servers using the
"xhost" and DISPLAY environment. 
<p>
<item> Very few system administrators required to maitain central server unlike
Windows 95 PC clients which need many administrators.
<p>
<item> Zero administration at diskless client side. Diskless computers 
are absolutely maintainence free and troublefree.
<p>
<item> Long life of diskless clients - more than <bf>300 years</bf> without any 
hardware or software upgrades.
<p>
<item> Eliminates install/upgrade of hardware, software on diskless client side.
<p>
<item> Eliminates cost of cdrom, floppy, tape drive, modem, UPS battery, Printer
parallel ports, serial ports etc..
<p>
<item> Can operate in places like factory floor where a hard disk might be too fragile.

<sect1> What is this ?
<p>
This chapter is written by Abhijit Dasgupta and is reproduced here from
<url url="http://www.nnaf.net/~abhijit/eep">. 
Abhijit's email :
       <htmlurl url="mailto:
		   abhijit@ans.net
	   " name="
		   abhijit@ans.net
	   ">

A photo of the burner is at - 
<url url="http://www.nnaf.net/~abhijit/pictures/eeprom-burner.jpg">

This is an eeprom burner for the 2816/2864 type of eeproms.
There are various designs available, but the main goal was to
have something which
<itemize>
<item> is cheap (less than $35)
<item> is easy to build and uses only commonly available parts
<item> works with linux
</itemize>

This one uses a handful of 74HCTxx logic chips all available
at the local Radio Shack store!  It uses the PC parallel port
interface, and Abhijit wrote the driver code for Linux only, but it
should be easy to modify it for other PC operating systems.

This was used to burn netboot PROMs for ethernet cards, which
were used to make diskless linux boxes.  See the netboot/etherboot
packages for details of how to do that.  You can also use it
for building microcontroller systems with external ROM (e.g. 8031).

<sect1> Construction
<p>
WARNING:  It is easy to destroy the parallel port of your PC by
connecting things to it.  It is also possible to damage or destroy
the whole PC, its attachments, peripherals, and people near it
by improper connections and electrical accidents.  USE EXTREME
CAUTION.  

Disclaimer:  Use at your own risk.  There is absolutely
no warranty of any kind here.

The programmer can be built on a breadboard, but use a protoboard
for a more permanent version.  Use 0.1uF power-bus bypass capacitors
generously.  The 5V power source can be obtained from the PC itself,
but be careful here.

<sect1> Usage
<p>
Download the software from <url url="http://www.nnaf.net/~abhijit/eep/eeprom.tar.gz">.
To build the software, just cd to the src directory and type `make';

<code>
readrom
-------
readrom will read a specified number of bytes from a 2816/2864 eeprom
starting at a given offset, and send it to the standard output in
either binary (raw) or ascii-hex listing format.

Usage:

    readrom -b|-t offset size

where

    -b            output binary (raw) bytes
    -t            output text (ascii-hex) listing
    offset        start address of eeprom, 0..8191
    size          number of bytes to output, 0..8192

Examples:

# read the contents of a 2864 in binary (raw) form and save it in a file:
readrom -b 0 8192 > contents.bin

# list 80 bytes starting at offset 32:
readrom -t 32 80


writerom
--------

writerom will read a given number of bytes from the standard input and
write them into a 2816/2864 eeprom starting at a specified offset.
writerom verifies the eeprom byte-by-byte as it writes into it.

Usage:

    writerom offset size

where

    offset        start address of eeprom, 0..8191
    size          number of bytes to output, 0..8192

Example:

# Write 8192 bytes from the file ne.lzrom into the eeprom:
writerom 0 8192 < ne.lzrom

<sect> EPROM Burners and Memory chips
<p>
Below is the information about EPROM and various types of memory chips.
<!-- 
	*******************************************
	************ End of Section ***************
	*******************************************




-->
<sect1> Non-Volatile Memory chips
<p>
Here is the brief descriptions of memory chips and their types.
<itemize>
<item> <bf>PROM</bf>:
Pronounced prom, an acronym for programmable read-only memory. A PROM is a memory chip on which data can be written only once. Once a program has been written onto a PROM, it remains there forever. Unlike RAM, PROMs retain their contents when the computer is turned off.  The difference between a PROM and a ROM (read-only memory) is that a PROM is manufactured as blank memory, whereas a ROM is programmed during the manufacturing process. To write data onto a PROM chip, you need a special device called a PROM programmer or PROM burner. The process of programming a PROM is sometimes called burning the PROM.  An EPROM (erasable programmable read-only memory) is a special type of PROM that can be erased by exposing it to ultraviolet light. Once it is erased, it can be reprogrammed. An EEPROM is similar to a PROM, but requires only electricity to be erased.  

<item> <bf>EPROM</bf>: 
Acronym for erasable programmable read-only memory, and pronounced e-prom, EPROM 
is a special type of memory that retains its contents until it is exposed to 
ultraviolet light. The ultraviolet light clears its contents, making it possible to 
reprogram the memory. To write to and erase an EPROM, you need a special device called
a PROM programmer or PROM burner.  An EPROM differs from a PROM in that a PROM can be 
written to only once and cannot be erased. EPROMs are used widely in personal computers 
because they enable the manufacturer to change the contents of the PROM before the 
computer is actually shipped. This means that bugs can be removed and new versions 
installed shortly before delivery. 

A note on EPROM technology: The bits of an EPROM are programmed 
by injecting electrons with an elevated 
voltage into the floating gate of a field-effect transistor 
where a 0 bit is desired. The electrons trapped
there cause that transistor to conduct, reading as 0. To erase 
the EPROM, the trapped electrons are given enough
energy to escape the floating gate by bombarding the chip with ultraviolet radiation 
through the quartz window.
To prevent slow erasure over a period of years from sunlight and 
fluorescent lights, this quartz window is covered with an opaque label in normal use.

<item> <bf>EEPROM</bf>:
Acronym for electrically erasable programmable read-only memory. Pronounced double-e-prom or e-e-prom, an EEPROM is a special type of PROM that can be erased by exposing it to an electrical charge. Like other types of PROM, EEPROM retains its contents even when the power is turned off. Also like other types of ROM, EEPROM is not as fast as RAM.  EEPROM is similar to flash memory (sometimes called flash EEPROM). The principal difference is that EEPROM requires data to be written or erased one byte at a time whereas flash memory allows data to be written or erased in blocks. This makes flash memory faster. 

<item> <bf>FRAM</bf>:
Short for Ferroelectric Random Access Memory, a type of non-volatile memory developed by Ramtron International Corporation. FRAM combines the access speed of DRAM and SRAM with the non-volatility of ROM. Because of its high speed, it is replacing EEPROM in many devices. The term FRAM itself is a trademark of Ramtron.  

<item> <bf>NVRAM</bf>:
Abbreviation of Non-Volatile Random Access Memory, a type of memory that retains its contents when power is turned off. One type of NVRAM is SRAM that is made non-volatile by connecting it to a constant power source such as a battery. Another type of NVRAM uses EEPROM chips to save its contents when power is turned off. In this case, NVRAM is composed of a combination of SRAM and EEPROM chips. 

<item> <bf>Bubble Memory</bf>:
A type of non-volatile memory composed of a thin layer of material that can be easily magnetized in only one direction. When a magnetic field is applied to circular area of this substance that is not magnetized in the same direction, the area is reduced to a smaller circle, or bubble.  It was once widely believed that bubble memory would become one of the leading memory technologies, but these promises have not been fulfilled. Other non-volatile memory types, such as EEPROM, are both faster and less expensive than bubble memory. 

<item> <bf>Flash Memory</bf>:
A special type of EEPROM that can be erased and reprogrammed in blocks instead of one byte at a time. Many modern PCs have their BIOS stored on a flash memory chip so that it can easily be updated if necessary. Such a BIOS is sometimes called a flash BIOS. Flash memory is also popular in modems because it enables the modem manufacturer to support new protocols as they become standardized.

<chapt> What is Network booting?
-->
<sect1> What is Network booting?
<p>

Network booting is an old idea. The central idea is that the computer has some bootstrap code 
in non-volatile memory, e.g. a ROM chip,
that will allow it to contact a server and obtain system files over a network link. 

<!-- 
	*******************************************
	************ End of Section ***************
	*******************************************




<chapt> How does it work
-->
<sect1> How does it work
<p>
In order to boot over the network, the computer must get 
<enum>
<item> an identity 
<item> an operating system image and 
<item> usually, a working filesystem. 
</enum>

Consider a diskless computer (DC) that has a network boot ROM. It may be one of several identical DCs. How can we distinguish this computer from others? There is one piece of information that is unique to that computer (actually its network adapter) and that is its Ethernet address. Every Ethernet adapter in the world has an unique 48 bit Ethernet address because every Ethernet hardware manufacturer has been assigned blocks of addresses. By convention these addresses are written as hex digits with colons separating each group of two digits, for example - <bf>00:60:08:C7:A3:D8</bf> .

The protocols used for obtaining an IP address, given an Ethernet address, are called <bf>Boot Protocol (BOOTP)</bf> and <bf>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</bf>. DHCP is an evolution of BOOTP. In our discussion, unless otherwise stated, anything that applies to BOOTP also applies to DHCP. (Actually it's a small lie that BOOTP and DHCP only translate Ethernet addresses. In their foresight, the designers made provision for BOOTP and DHCP to work with any kind of hardware address. But Ethernet is what most people will be using.)

An example of a BOOTP exchange goes like this:

<bf>DC:</bf> Hello, my hardware address is <bf>00:60:08:C7:A3:D8</bf>, please give me my IP address.  

<bf>BOOTP server:</bf> (Looks up address in database.) Your name is aldebaran, your IP address is 192.168.1.100, your server is 192.168.1.1, the file you are supposed to boot from is /tftpboot/vmlinux.nb (and a few other pieces of information).

You may wonder how the DC found the address of the BOOTP server in the first place. The answer is that it didn't. The BOOTP request was broadcast on the local network and any BOOTP server that can answer the request will.

After obtaining an IP address, the DC must download an operating system image and execute it. Another Internet protocol is used here, called <bf>Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)</bf>. TFTP is like a cut-down version of FTP---there is no authentication, and it runs over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) instead of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). UDP was chosen instead of TCP for simplicity. The implementation of UDP on the DC can be small so the code is easy to fit on a ROM. Because UDP is a block oriented, as opposed to a stream oriented, protocol, the transfer goes block by block, like this:


<tscreen><verb>
DC: Give me block 1 of /tftpboot/vmlinux.nb.
TFTP server: Here it is.
DC: Give me block 2.
</verb></tscreen>


and so on, until the whole file is transferred. Handshaking is a simply acknowledge each block scheme, and packet loss is handled by retransmit on timeout. When all blocks have been received, the network boot ROM hands control to the operating system image at the entry point.

Finally, in order to run an operating system, a root filesystem must be provided. The protocol used by Linux and other Unixes is normally <bf>Network File System (NFS)</bf>, although other choices are possible. In this case the code does not have to reside in the ROM but can be part of the operating system we just downloaded. However the operating system must be capable of running with a root filesystem that is a NFS, instead of a real disk. Linux has the required configuration variables to build a version that can do so.

<chapt>Netbooting in Practice
-->
<sect1> Netbooting in Practice
<p>
Net Loader is a small program that runs as a BIOS extension, usually on 
an EPROM on the NIC. It handles the BOOTP query and TFTP loading
and then transfers control to the loaded image. 
It uses TCP/IP protocols but the loaded image doesn't have to be Linux. The loaded image can be anything, even DOS. 
They can also be loaded from a floppy for testing and for temporary setups. 

Besides commercial boot ROMs, there are <bf>TWO</bf> sources for free packages for network booting.
Free implementations of TCP/IP net loaders are - 
<enum>
<item> <bf>ETHERBOOT</bf> <url url="http://www.slug.org.au/etherboot/">  and
<item> <bf>NETBOOT</bf> <url url="http://www.han.de/~gero/netboot.html">
</enum>

Etherboot uses built-in drivers while Netboot uses Packet drivers. 
First you have to ascertain that your network card is supported by Etherboot or Netboot. Eventually you have to find a person who is willing to put the code on an EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory) for you but in the beginning 
you can do <bf>network booting from a floppy</bf>. 

To create a boot floppy, a special boot block is provided in the distribution. This small 512 byte program loads the disk blocks following it on the floppy into memory and starts execution. Thus to make a boot floppy, one has only to concatenate the boot block with the Etherboot binary containing the driver for one's network card like this:

<code>
	# cat floppyload.bin 3c509.lzrom > /dev/fd0
</code>

  Get the nfsboot package (the package is available from your favourite
  linux mirror site in the /pub/Linux/system/Linux-boot directory). It
  contains a booteprom image for the network cards (like wd8013) which can be directly
  burned in. See also the 
LTSP site at <url url="http://www.ltsp.org">

Before you put in the network boot floppy, you have to set up three services on Linux - 
<enum>
<item> BOOTP (or DHCP)
<item> TFTP and
<item> NFS. 
</enum>

You don't have to set up all three at once, you can do them step by step, making sure each step works before going on to the next.

<sect2> Bootp
<p>
Install Bootp. See bootp*.rpm on Redhat linux cdrom. 
See also LTSP site for RPM packages at <url url="http://www.ltsp.org">.
See also unix manual pages 'man 5 bootptab', 'man 8 bootpd', 'man 8 bootpef', 'man 8 bootptest'.
You then have to ensure that this server is waiting for bootp requests. 
The daemon can be run either directly by issuing command
<code>
       bootpd -s
</code>

Or by using inetd
edit the file /etc/inetd.conf and put a line like this:

<code>
	bootps dgram   udp     wait    root    /usr/sbin/in.bootpd    bootpd
</code>
Insert or uncomment the following two lines in /etc/services:
<code>
bootps          67/tcp          # BOOTP server
tftp            69/udp          # TFTP server
</code>

If you had to modify /etc/inetd.conf, then you need to restart inetd by sending the process a HUP signal.
<code>
       kill -HUP <process id of inetd>.
</code>

Next, you need to give bootp a database to map Ethernet addresses to IP addresses. This database 
is in /etc/bootptab. 
  You must modify it by inserting the IP addresses of
  your gateway, dns server, and the ethernet address(es) of your
  diskless machine(s).  
It contains lines of the following form:

<code>
	aldebaran.foo.com:ha=006008C7A3D8:ip=192.168.1.100:bf=/tftpboot/vmlinuz.nb 
</code>

Other information can be specified but we will start simple.

Another example of /etc/bootptab is :

<code>
  global.prof:\
          :sm=255.255.255.0:\
          :ds=192.168.1.5:\
          :gw=192.168.1.19:\
          :ht=ethernet:\
          :bf=linux:
  machine1:hd=/export/root/machine1:tc=global.prof:ha=0000c0863d7a:ip=192.168.1.140:
  machine2:hd=/export/root/machine2:tc=global.prof:ha=0800110244e1:ip=192.168.1.141:
  machine3:hd=/export/root/machine3:tc=global.prof:ha=0800110244de:ip=192.168.1.142:
</code>

  global.prof is a general template for host entries, where

<itemize>
<item> sm field contains the subnet mask
<item> ds field contains the address of the Domain Name Server
<item> gw field contains the default gateway address
<item> ht field contains the lan media hardware type
<item> bf field contains the name of the boot file
</itemize>

  After this, every machine must have a line:

<itemize>
<item>  the first field contains the host name,
<item>  hd field contains the directory of the bootfile,
<item>  the global template can be included with the tc field,
<item>  ha field contains the hardvare address of the ethernet card,
<item>  ip field contains the assigned ip address.
</itemize>

Now boot the DC with the floppy and it should detect your Ethernet card and broadcast a BOOTP request. If 
all goes well, the server should respond to the DC with the information required. Since /tftpboot/vmlinux.nb 
doesn't exist yet, it will fail when it tries to load the file.  Now you need to compile a special kernel, 
one that has the option for mounting the root filesystem from NFS turned on. You also need to enable the 
option to get the IP address of the kernel from the original BOOTP reply. You also need to compile the 
Linux driver for your network adapter into the kernel instead of loading it as a module. It is possible
to download an initial ramdisk so that module loading works but this is something you can do later.

You cannot install the zImage resulting from the kernel compilation directly. It has to be turned into a tagged image. A tagged image is a normal kernel image with a special header that tells the network bootloader where the bytes go in memory and at what address to start the program. You use a program called mknbi-linux to create this tagged image. This utility can be found in the Etherboot distribution. After you have generated the image, put it in the /tftpboot directory under the name specified in /etc/bootptab. Make sure to make this file world readable because the tftp server does not have special privileges.

<sect2> Tftp
<p>
For TFTP, see tftp*.rpm on Redhat Linux cdrom. 
  TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) is a file transfer protocol,
  such as ftp, but it's much simpler to help coding it in EPROMs. TFTP
  can be used in two ways:

<itemize>
<item> <bf>Simple tftp:</bf> means that the client can acces to your whole file
     system. It's simpler but it's a big security hole (anyone can get
     your password file via tftp).
<item> <bf>Secure tftp:</bf> the tftp server uses a chroot.2 system call to change
     it's own root directory. Anything outside the new root directory
     will be completely inaccessible. Because of the chroot dir becomes
     the new root dir, the hd filed in the bootptab must reflect the new
     situation. For example: 
	 when using insecure tftp, the hd field
     contains the full path to the boot directory:
     /export/root/machine1.  When using secure tftp whith /export as
     root dir, then /export becomes / and the hd field must be
     /root/machine1.
</itemize>

Tftpd is normally started up from 
inetd with a line like this in /etc/inetd.conf.

<code>
tftp dgram udp wait root /usr/sbin/tcpd in.tftpd -s /tftpboot
#tftp   dgram   udp     wait    root    /usr/sbin/in.tftpd     tftpd /export
</code>

Again, restart inetd with a HUP signal and you can retry the boot and this time it 
should download the kernel image and start it. You will find that the boot will 
continue until the point where it tries to mount a root filesystem. At this 
point you must configure and export NFS partitions to proceed.

<sect2> NFS root filesystem
<p>
For various reasons, it's not a good idea to use the root filesystem of the server as
the root filesystem of the DCs. One is simply that there are various configuration 
files there and the DC will get the wrong information that way. Another 
is security. It's dangerous to allow write access (and write access is needed 
for the root filesystem, for various reasons) to your server's root. However 
the good news is that a root filesystem for the DC is not very large, only 
about 30 MB and a lot of this can be shared between multiple DCs.

Ideally, to construct a root filesystem, you have to know what files your 
operating system distribution is expecting to see there. Critical to booting are 
device files, files in /sbin and /etc. You can bypass a lot of the hard work 
by making a copy of an existing root filesystem and modifying some files for 
the DC. In the Etherboot distribution, there is a tutorial and links to a 
couple of shell scripts that will create such a DC root filesystem from an 
existing server root filesystem. There are also troubleshooting tips in the 
Etherboot documentation as this is often the trickiest part of the setup.

The customised Linux kernel for the DC expects to see the root 
filesystem at /tftpboot/(IP address of the DC), for 
example: /tftpboot/192.168.1.100 in the case above. This can be 
changed when configuring the kernel, if desired.

Now create or edit /etc/exports (see 'man 5 exports' and 'man 8 exportfs') on the server and 
put in a line of the following form:

<code>
/tftpboot/192.168.1.100 aldebaran.foo.com(rw,no_root_squash)
</code>

The rw access is needed for various system services. The no_root_squash attribute prevents the NFS system from mapping root's ID to another one. If this is not specified, then various daemons and loggers will be unhappy.

Start or restart the NFS services (rpc.portmap and rpc.mountd) and retry the 
diskless boot.  If you are successful, the kernel should be able to mount a root 
filesystem and boot all the way to a login prompt. Most likely, you will find
several things misconfigured. Most Linux distributions are oriented towards disked 
operation and require a little modification to suit diskless booting. The most common 
failing is reliance on files under /usr during the boot process, which is 
normally imported from a server late in the boot process. Two possible solutions are -

<enum>
<item> Provide the few required files under a small /usr directory on 
the root filesystem, which will then be overlaid when /usr is imported, and 
<p>
<item> Modify the paths to look for the files in the root filesystem. The 
files to edit are under /tftpboot/192.168.1.100 (remember, this is 
the root directory of the DC).
</enum>

You may wish to mount other directories from the server, such as /usr (which can be exported read-only).

<sect2> Burn EPROM

When you are satisfied that you can boot over the network without any problems, you
may wish to put the code on an EPROM.

<sect1> Uses of Network booting
<p>
X-terminals are one natural use of network booting. The lack of a disk in the terminal makes it quieter and contributes to a pleasant working environment. The machine should ideally have 16MB of memory or more and the best video card you can find for it. This is an ideal use for a high-end 486 or low-end Pentium that has been obsoleted by hardware advances.  Other people have used network booting for clusters of machines where the usage is light on the DC and does not warrant a disk, e.g. a cluster of classroom machines.

<sect> Redhat Linux configuration
<p>
The DC requests to mount /tftpboot/&lt <it>IP address of DC</it> &gt 
(in Linux Kernel 2.1 and above it is - /tftpboot/&lt <it>name of DC in bootptab</it> &gt )
as its root directory '/' by NFS from server. You must export this from the 
server (rw, no_root_squash) because the DC wants to write on it (log
files, etc). 

The root directory / must contain /sbin, /bin, /lib, /etc, /var, /tmp, /root, /dev and /proc. 

/sbin, /bin, /lib can be a copy of an existing Redhat Linux system. They can be 
shared between all DCs. But hard links only. By the way, don't link to server originals. 

/etc, /var and /dev should be non-sharable copies. Customise /etc/sysconfig/network,
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0, /etc/fstab, /etc/conf.modules, and others. Turn off all
network services you don't need. Remove all stuff you don't need from /var, e.g. RPM db, lpd files. 

/root and /proc should just exist. /tmp should exist and be mode 1777. 

You probably want to create /usr and /home mount points. /usr can be mounted ro (read-only). 

About 10 MB per DC plus about 15 MB of shared files should be sufficient. By the way, if 
your DCs are quite similar, the kernel image can also be shared. 

Here is an illustrative script to create the first root filesystem.
<code>
#!/bin/sh
if [ $# != 1 ]
then
	echo Usage: $0 client-IP-addr
	exit 1
fi

cd /

umask 022

mkdir -p /tftpboot/$1

# just make these ones
for d in home mnt proc tmp usr
do
	mkdir /tftpboot/$1/$d
	done

	chmod 1777 /tftpboot/$1/tmp

	touch /tftpboot/$1/fastboot
	chattr +i /tftpboot/$1/fastboot

	# copy these ones
	cp -a bin lib sbin dev etc root var /tftpboot/$1

cat <<EOF
Now, in /tftpboot/$1/etc, edit

		sysconfig/network
		sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
		fstab
		conf.modules

and configure

		rc.d/rc3.d
EOF
</code>

Here is an illustrative script to duplicate the root filesystem
<code>
#!/bin/sh
if [ $# != 2 ]
then
	echo Usage: $0 olddir newdir
	exit 1
fi

cd /tftpboot

if [ ! -d $1 ]
then
	echo $1 is not a directory
	exit 1
fi

umask 022

mkdir -p $2

# just make these ones
for d in home mnt proc tmp usr
do
	mkdir $2/$d
done

chmod 1777 $2/tmp

touch $2/fastboot
chattr +i $2/fastboot

# link these ones
for d in bin lib sbin
do
	(cd $1; find $d -print | cpio -pl ../$2)
done

# copy these ones
for d in dev etc root var
do
	cp -a $1/$d $2
done

cat <<EOF
Now, in /tftpboot/$2/etc, edit

	sysconfig/network
	sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
	fstab (maybe)
	conf.modules (maybe)

and configure

	rc.d/rc3.d
EOF
</code>

<sect1> X-terminal
<p>
On the server, make sure the DC is matched by a clause in /etc/X11/xdm/Xaccess and comment out the :0 in
/etc/X11/xdm/Xservers. Then make sure that xdm is run from the init scripts. 

On the client, run X -query server 

You will get the xdm login box and then all your X clients will run on the server. 

For other applications use - you could use diskless technique for  netboot 
routers, print servers (but should not be spooling print server), standalone apps, etc.

<sect> LanWorks BootWare PROMs <label id="LanWorks">
<p>
This information may save you time. 
In order to make LanWorks BootWare(tm) PROMs to correctly start up a
Linux kernel image, the "bootsector" part of the image must be modified
so as to enable the boot prom to jump right into the image start address.
The net-bootable image format created by netboot/etherboot's
`mknbi-linux' tool differs and will not run if used with BootWare PROMs.

A modified bootsector together with a Makefile to create a BootWare-bootable
image after kernel compilation can be found at -

<item> LanWorks BootWare Boot ROMs <url url="http://www.3com.com/lanworks">

Refer to the README file for installation details. Currently, only
"zImage"-type kernels are supported. Unfortunately, kernel parameters
are ignored.

<sect>Etherboot
<p>
Etherboot is a package for creating ROM images that can download code
over the network to be executed on an x86 computer. Typically the
computer is diskless and the code is Linux, but these are not the only
possibilities.

This document is at <url url="http://www.slug.org.au/etherboot/" name="the Etherboot Home Page">.
This document explains how to install, configure and use the Etherboot package.

<sect1> Introduction
<p>
The following list shows just a few examples of what Netboot can be used for: 

<itemize>
<item>Printer spooler 
<item>Terminal server 
<item>X11 terminal 
<item>Data logging system 
<item>Network-Computer (NC) 
<item>Some more ....
</itemize>

For the bootrom to find the kernel image it uses the BOOTP protocol as defined in <ref id="RFCs"> and <ref id="RFCs"> to get the necessary
boot information, and then loads the actual image using the TFTP protocol as defined in <ref id="RFCs">. 

The exact specifications for this netboot process can be found <url url="http://www.han.de/~gero/netboot/english/spec.html">.

<sect1> Mailing list 
<p>
There exists a mailing list devoted to network booting. To subscribe simply send a mail with the line 

subscribe netboot

Any help from you to translate to other languages is welcome.
</itemize>
The document is written using a tool called "SGML-Tools" which can be got from - 
<url url="http://www.sgmltools.org">
Compiling the source you will get the following commands like
<itemize>
<item>sgml2html CVS-HOWTO.sgml     (to generate html file)
<item>sgml2rtf  CVS-HOWTO.sgml     (to generate RTF file)
<item>sgml2latex CVS-HOWTO.sgml    (to generate latex file)
</itemize>

LaTeX documents may be converted into PDF files simply by 
producing a Postscript output using <bf>sgml2latex</bf> ( and dvips) and running the
output through the Acrobat <bf>distill</bf> (<url url="http://www.adobe.com">) command as follows: 
<code>
bash$ man sgml2latex
bash$ sgml2latex filename.sgml
bash$ man dvips
bash$ dvips -o filename.ps filename.dvi
bash$ distill filename.ps
bash$ man ghostscript
bash$ man ps2pdf
bash$ ps2pdf input.ps output.pdf
bash$ acroread output.pdf &
</code>
Or you can use Ghostscript command <bf>ps2pdf</bf>.
ps2pdf is a work-alike for nearly all the functionality of 
Adobe's Acrobat Distiller product: it
converts PostScript files to Portable Document Format (PDF) files. 
<bf>ps2pdf</bf> is implemented as a very small command script (batch file) that invokes Ghostscript, selecting a special "output device"
called <bf>pdfwrite</bf>. In order to use ps2pdf, the pdfwrite device must be included in the makefile when Ghostscript was compiled;
see the documentation on building Ghostscript for details.
