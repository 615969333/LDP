CPU is the "brain" of computer and is a very vital component
of computer system and is like a "cousin brother" of operating system
(Linux or Unix).
This document helps companies, businesses, universities and
research institutes to design, build and manufacture CPUs.
Also the information will be useful for university students of U.S.A and
Canada who are studying computer science/engineering. The document
has URL links which helps students understand how a CPU is designed 
and manufactured. Perhaps in near future there will GNU/GPLed CPU
running Linux/Unix operating systems!!

<sect>Introduction
<p>
This document provides you comprehensive list of URLs for CPU Design
and fabrication. Using this information students, companies, universities
 or businesses can make new CPUs which can run Linux/Unix operating systems.

In olden days, chip vendors were also the IP developers and the EDA tools
 developers. Nowadays, we have specialized fab companies 
(TSMC <url url="http://www.tsmc.com">), 
IP companies (ARM <url url="http://www.arm.com">,
MIPS <url url="http://www.mips.com">, 
Gray Research LLC <url url="http://cnets.sourceforge.net/grllc.html">
), and tools companies (
Mentor <url url="http://www.mentor.com">, 
Cadence <url url="http://www.cadence.com">, etc.), 
and combinations of 
these (Intel). You can buy IP bundled with hardware (Intel), bundled with
 your tools (EDA 
companies), or separately (IP providers). 

Enter the FPGA vendors (Xilinx <url url="http://www.xilinx.com">, 
Altera <url url="http://www.altera.com">). They have an opportunity to seize
 upon a unique business model. 

VA Linux systems <url url="http://www.valinux.com"> builds the entire 
system and perhaps in future will design and build CPUs for Linux.

<chapt> What is IP ?
-->
<sect> What is IP ?
<p>
What is IP ? IP is short for <bf>Intellectual Property</bf>. More specifically, it is 
a block of logic that can be used in making ASIC's and FPGA's.  Examples 
of "IP Cores" are, UART's, CPU's, Ethernet Controllers, PCI Interfaces, etc.
In the past, quality cores of this nature could cost anywhere from US$5,000 to
more than US$350,000.  This is way too high for the average company or 
individual to even contemplate using -- Hence, the Free-IP project.

Initially the Free-IP project will focus on the more complex cores, like
CPU's and Ethernet controllers.  Less complex cores might follow.

The Free-IP project is an effort to make quality IP available to anyone.

Visit the following sites for IP cores - 
<itemize>
<item> Open IP org <url url="http://www.openip.org">
<item> Free IP org - ASIC and FPGA cores for masses <url url="http://www.free-ip.com">
<item> FPGA Main site <url url="http://www.fpgacpu.org">

<p>
After doing the design and testing of CPU, your company may want to mass produce 
the CPUs. There are many "semi-conductor foundries" in the world who will do
that for you for a nominal competetive cost. There are companies in USA, 
Germany, UK, Japan, Taiwan, Korea and China. 
TMSC (Taiwan) is the <bf>"largest independent foundry"</bf> in the world. 
You may want to shop around and you will get the best rate 
for a very high volume production (greater than 100,000 CPU units).

<sect1> Foundry Business is in Billions of dollars!!
<p>
Foundry companies invested very heavily in the infra-structure
and building plants runs in several millions of dollars!
Silicon foundry business will grow from $7 billion to $36 
billion by 2004 (414% increase!!).
More integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) opt to outsource
chip production verses adding wafer-processing capacity.

Independent foundries currently produce about 12% of the semiconductors 
in the world, and by 2004, that share will more than double to 26%. 

The "Big Three" pure-play foundries are -- Taiwan 
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC),
United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC), 
and Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd. Pte.--collectively 
account for 69% of today's silicon foundry volume, but 
their share is expected to grow to 88% by 2004.

<chapt change> Other Formats of this Document
-->
<sect> Other Formats of this Document
<p>
This document is published in 11 different formats namely - DVI, Postscript, 
Latex, Adobe Acrobat PDF,
LyX, GNU-info, HTML, RTF(Rich Text Format), Plain-text, Unix man pages and SGML.
<itemize>
<item>
You can get this HOWTO document as a single file tar ball in HTML, DVI, 
Postscript or SGML formats from -
<url url="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/">

<item>Plain text format is in: <url url="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO">

<item>Translations to other languages like French, German, Spanish, 
Chinese, Japanese are in
<url url="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO">
Any help from you to translate to other languages is welcome.
</itemize>
The document is written using a tool called "SGML-Tools" which can be got from - 
<url url="http://www.sgmltools.org">
Compiling the source you will get the following commands like
<itemize>
<item>sgml2html CPU-Design-HOWTO.sgml     (to generate html file)
<item>sgml2rtf  CPU-Design-HOWTO.sgml     (to generate RTF file)
<item>sgml2latex CPU-Design-HOWTO.sgml    (to generate latex file)
</itemize>

LaTeX documents may be converted into PDF files simply by 
producing a Postscript output using <bf>sgml2latex</bf> ( and dvips) and running the
output through the Acrobat <bf>distill</bf> (<url url="http://www.adobe.com">) command as follows: 
<code>
bash$ man sgml2latex
bash$ sgml2latex filename.sgml
bash$ man dvips
bash$ dvips -o filename.ps filename.dvi
bash$ distill filename.ps
bash$ man ghostscript
bash$ man ps2pdf
bash$ ps2pdf input.ps output.pdf
bash$ acroread output.pdf &
</code>
Or you can use Ghostscript command <bf>ps2pdf</bf>.
ps2pdf is a work-alike for nearly all the functionality of 
Adobe's Acrobat Distiller product: it
converts PostScript files to Portable Document Format (PDF) files. 
<bf>ps2pdf</bf> is implemented as a very small command script (batch file) that invokes Ghostscript, selecting a special "output device"
called <bf>pdfwrite</bf>. In order to use ps2pdf, the pdfwrite device must be included in the makefile when Ghostscript was compiled;
see the documentation on building Ghostscript for details.

</itemize>


In order to view the document in dvi format, use the xdvi program. The xdvi
program is located in tetex-xdvi*.rpm package in Redhat Linux which can be
located through ControlPanel | Applications | Publishing | TeX menu buttons.
	To read dvi document give the command -
<tscreen><verb>
	xdvi -geometry 80x90 howto.dvi
	man xdvi
</verb></tscreen>
	And resize the window with mouse.
	To navigate use Arrow keys, Page Up, Page Down keys, also
	you can use 'f', 'd', 'u', 'c', 'l', 'r', 'p', 'n' letter
	keys to move up, down, center, next page, previous page etc.
	To turn off expert menu press 'x'.

You can read postscript file using the program 'gv' (ghostview) or 
'ghostscript'.
The ghostscript program is in ghostscript*.rpm package and gv 
program is in gv*.rpm package in Redhat Linux
which can be located through ControlPanel | Applications | Graphics menu 
buttons. The gv program is much more user friendly than ghostscript.
Also ghostscript and gv are available on other platforms like OS/2,
Windows 95 and NT, you view this document even on those platforms.
 
<itemize>
<item>Get ghostscript for Windows 95, OS/2, and for all OSes from <url url="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost">
</itemize>

To read postscript document give the command -
<tscreen><verb>
		gv howto.ps
		ghostscript howto.ps
</verb></tscreen>

You can read HTML format document using Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet
explorer, Redhat Baron Web browser or any of the 10 other web browsers.

You can read the latex, LyX output using LyX a X-Windows front end to latex.
