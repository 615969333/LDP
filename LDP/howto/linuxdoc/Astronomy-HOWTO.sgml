<sect> Introduction

<sect1> Knowledge Required
<p>
With all the help from major Linux distributions such as SuSE, Redhat, Caldera and many others, Linux based systems are becoming easier to use.  However, there is still some need of understanding of basic UNIX skills to make the most of Linux.  Thus, this HOWTO will assume that the reader has at least a basic knowledge of using a UNIX system including the ability to compile and install programs.
A few resources we have found useful over the years include:

<itemize>
<item> "A Practical Guide to the UNIX System", Mark G. Sobel
<item> "Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment", the late W. Richard Stevens
<item> "Running LINUX", Matt Welsh et al.
<item> "LINUX Device Drivers", Alessandro Rubini
</itemize>

Similarly, this is not a tutorial or reference for astronomy principles or
astronomical instrumentation. Astronomy is perhaps the grandest of all
sciences, employing widely disparate disciplines in a bold attempt to
understand nothing less than the universe itself. Your interests will lead
in many directions. A few references we have used include:

<itemize>
<item> "Astronomy with your Personal Computer", Peter Duffett-Smith
<item> "Astronomy on the Personal Computer", Oliver Montenbruck et al
<item> "Textbook on Spherical Astronomy", W. M. Smart
<item> "The Astronomy and Astrophysics Encyclopedia", Stephen P. Maran, ed.
</itemize>

<sect1> Scope
<p>
The authors define the scope of this HOWTO as primarily an index
to Linux tools applicable in some fashion to the pursuit of Astronomy. It
is *not* our intention to list WWW astronomy references in general. Our
own interests tend more towards the technology than the pure science and so
we welcome contributions from others who have found Linux tools which
contribute in other ways to Astronomy. Please contact us at the address
above.

<sect1> Planetarium Programs
<p>
Here is discussion of whole programs for use in finding objects, natural and
man-made, in the sky which run on Linux.

<p>
<itemize>
<item> <htmlurl url="http://clearskyinstitute.com/xephem" name="XEphem">
has been the pet project of one of us (Downey) for the past
15-odd years. It has grown to become one of the more capable
interactive tools for the computation of astronomical ephemerides.

<item> <htmlurl url="http://venus.sunquest.com/xsky_blurb.html" name="XSky">

stars and planets.

</itemize>
<sect1> Libraries
<p>
This section discusses bits and pieces of software that can be used to form the
basis for specialized projects.

Much effort exists to allow access to Astronomical image file type such as FITS from any web browser.  Here are some pointers.

<sect1> List
<p>
The folks at harvard have a list of Image Servers and Image Browsers.

<itemize>

<p>
<itemize>

<item> The yearly <htmlurl url="http://hea-www.harvard.edu/adass" name="Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems, ADAAS,">
Conference Series provides a forum for scientists and computer specialists
concerned with algorithms, software and operating systems in the acquisition,
reduction and analysis of astronomical data.  The program includes invited
talks, contributed papers and poster sessions as well as user group meetings
and special interest meetings ("BOFs'').  All these activities aim to
encourage communication between software specialists and users, and also to
stimulate further development of astronomical software and systems.  

<item>
The linuxastro mailing list, linuxastro@majordomo.cv.nrao.edu, is for
people who are interested in porting astronomical software to linux. For
more information, see
<htmlurl url="http://bima.astro.umd.edu/nemo/linuxastro" name="linuxastro">.

</itemize>

<sect> Hardware Control
<p>
More folks are using Linux to control equipment.  Users range from amateur astronomers in the field to professional observatories.

<sect1> Telescope Control
<p>
<itemize>

<item>
<htmlurl url="http://www.torusoptics.com/OCAAS.htm" name="OCAAS"> is a
complete Observatory Control and Astronomical Analysis System for Linux.

<item> <htmlurl url="http://clearskyinstitute.com/xephem" name="XEphem">

<sect> Installation Help
<p>
You need to know what you're doing with Linux and installing programs, but help is available for some programs.  Here are some ways to make life easier.

<itemize>

<item>
<htmlurl url="http://bima.astro.umd.edu/nemo/linuxastro/astromake/" name="AstroMake">
is is a utility intended to make installations of some common astronomical packages (in binary form) easy.

<item>
XEphem requires several elements to exist on your machine.  Life is much
simpler with the CDROM version of the program as it contains an installation
script which loads the appropriate precompiled binary for most systems and
places all auxiliary files to the correct spots. See
