<abstract>
This HOWTO reviews main issues (and I hope solutions) related to SMP
configuration under Linux.
</abstract>

<toc>

<sect>Introduction

<p>
Linux works on SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processors) machines. SMP support
was introduced with kernel version 2.0, and has improved steadily ever
since.  The kernel locking granularity is much finer in 2.2.x than in
2.0.x, which enables better performance when processes are accessing the
kernel!

<sect>Questions related to any architectures

<p>
<sect1>Kernel Side
<p>

<p>
<enum>
<item> <bf>Does Linux support multi-threading?  If I start two or more
processes, will they be distributed among the available CPUs?</bf>
<p>
Yes. Processes and kernel-threads are distributed among processors.
User-space threads are not.

<item> <bf>What kind of architectures are supported in SMP?</bf>
<p>
<descrip>
<tag/From <bf>Alan Cox</bf>:/
<p>
SMP is supported in 2.0 on the hypersparc (SS20, etc.) systems and Intel
486, Pentium or higher machines which are Intel MP1.1/1.4
compliant. <bf>Richard Jelinek</bf> adds: right now, systems have been
tested up to 4 CPUs and the MP standard (and so Linux) theoretically
allows up to 16 CPUs.
<p>
SMP support for UltraSparc, SparcServer, Alpha and PowerPC machines is
in available in 2.2.x.
<p>
<tag/From <bf>Ralf Bächle</bf>:/ MIPS, m68k and ARM does not
support SMP; the latter two probly won't ever.
<p>
That is, I'm going to hack on MIPS-SMP as soon as I get a SMP box ...
</descrip>

<item> <bf>How do I make a Linux SMP kernel?</bf>
<p>
Most Linux distributions don't provide a ready-made SMP-aware kernel,
which means that you'll have to make one yourself. If you haven't made
your own kernel yet, this is a great reason to learn how.  Explaining
how to make a new kernel is beyond the scope of this document; refer to
the Linux Kernel Howto for more information. (<bf>C. Polisher</bf>)

In kernel series 2.0 up to but not including 2.1.132, uncomment the
<tt/SMP=1/ line in the main Makefile (<tt>/usr/src/linux/Makefile</>).
<p>
In the 2.2 version, configure the kernel and answer "yes" to the
question "Symmetric multi-processing support" (<bf>Michael Elizabeth
Chastain</bf>).

AND

enable real time clock support by configuring the "RTC support" item
(from <bf>Robert G.  Brown</bf>). Note that inserting RTC support
actually doesn't afaik prevent the known problem with SMP clock drift,
but enabling this feature prevents lockup when the clock is read at boot
time. A note from <bf>Richard Jelinek</bf> says also that activating the
Enhanced RTC is necessary to get the second CPU working (identified) on
some original Intel Mainboards.

AND

(x86 kernel) do NOT enable APM (advanced power management)! APM and SMP
are not compatible, and your
system will almost certainly (or at least probably <tt>;)</>) crash
while booting if APM is enabled (<bf>Jakob Oestergaard</bf>). <bf>Alan
Cox</bf> confirms this : 2.1.x turns APM off for SMP boxes.  Basically
APM is undefined in the presence of SMP systems, and anything could
occur.

AND

(x86 kernel) enable "MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support". Some
BIOS are buggy as they do not activate cache memory for the second
processor. The MTRR support contains code that solves such processor
misconfiguration.

<p>

You must rebuild all your kernel and kernel modules when changing to and
from SMP mode. Remember to <tt>make modules</> and <tt>make
modules_install</> (from <bf>Alan Cox</bf>).

<p>
If you get module load errors, you probably did not rebuild and/or
re-install your modules.  Also with some 2.2.x kernels people have
reported problems when changing the compile from SMP back to UP
(uni-processor).  To fix this, save your .config file, do <em>make
mrproper</em>, restore your <em>.config</em> file, then remake your
kernel (<em>make dep</em>, etc.)  (<bf>Wade Hampton</bf>). Do not forget
to run lilo after copying your new kernel.
<p>
Recap:
<code>
make config # or menuconfig or xconfig
make dep
make clean
make bzImage # or whatever you want
# copy the kernel image manually then RUN LILO 
# or make lilo
make modules
make modules_install
</code>
<p>

<item> <bf>How do I make a Linux <bf>non</bf>-SMP kernel?</bf>
<p>
In the 2.0 series, <bf>comment</bf> the <tt/SMP=1/ line in the main
Makefile (/usr/src/linux/Makefile).
<p>
In the 2.2 series, configure the kernel and answer "no" to the question
"Symmetric multi-processing support" (<bf>Michael Elizabeth
Chastain</bf>).


<p>

You must rebuild all your kernel and kernel modules when changing to and
from SMP mode. Remember to <tt>make modules</> and <tt>make
modules_install</> and remember to run lilo.  See notes above about
possible configuration problems.


<item> <bf>How can I tell if it worked?</bf>
<p>
<verb> cat /proc/cpuinfo </verb>

<p>
Typical output (dual PentiumII):
<code>
processor       : 0
cpu             : 686
model           : 3
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
[...]
bogomips        : 267.06
 
processor       : 1
cpu             : 686
model           : 3
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
[...]
bogomips        : 267.06
</code>

<item> <bf>What is the status of converting the kernel toward finer
grained locking and multithreading?</bf>
<p>
Linux kernel version 2.2 has signal handling, interrupts and some I/O stuff fine grain
locked.  The rest is gradually migrating. All the scheduling is SMP
safe.

<p>
Kernel version 2.3 (next 2.4) has really fine grained locking. In the 2.3 kernels
the usage of the big kernel lock has basically disappeared, all major
Linux kernel subsystems are fully threaded: networking, VFS, VM, IO,
block/page caches, scheduling, interrupts, signals, etc. (<bf>Ingo
Molnar</bf>)

<item> <bf>Does Linux SMP support processor affinity?</bf>
<p>
<descrip>

<tag/Standard kernel/
No and Yes.  There is no way to force a process onto specific CPU's but
the linux scheduler has a processor bias for each process, which tends
to keep processes tied to a specific CPU.

<tag/Patch/
Yes. Look at <url name="PSET - Processor Sets for the Linux kernel"
url="http://isunix.it.ilstu.edu/~thockin/pset/">:
<quote>
The goal of this project is to make a source compatible and functionally
equivalent version of pset (as defined by SGI - partially removed from
their IRIX 6.4 kernel) for Linux.  This enables users to determine which
processor or set of processors a process may run on.  Possible uses
include forcing threads to separate processors, timings, security (a
`root' only CPU?) and probably more.
</quote>

It is focused around the syscall sysmp().  This function takes a number of
parameters that determine which function is requested.  Functions
include:
<itemize>
	<item> binding a process/thread to a specific CPU
	<item> restricting a CPU's ability to execute some processes
	<item> restricting a CPU from running at all
	<item> forcing a cpu to run _only_ one process (and its children)
	<item> getting information about a CPU's state
	<item> creating/destroying sets of processors, to which processes may be
	  bound
</itemize>

</descrip>

<item> <bf>Where should one report SMP bugs to?</bf>
<p>
Please report bugs to <tt>linux-smp@vger.rutgers.edu</>.

<item> <bf>What about SMP performance?</bf>
<p>
If you want to gauge the performance of your SMP system, you can run some tests made by
Cameron MacKinnon and available at <htmlurl
name="http://www.phy.duke.edu/brahma/benchmarks.smp"
url="http://www.phy.duke.edu/brahma/benchmarks.smp">.

</enum>

<p>
<sect1>User Side

<p>
<enum>

<item> <bf>Do I really need SMP?</bf>
<p>
If you have to ask, you probably don't. <tt/:)/
Generally, multi-processor systems can provide better performance
than uni-processor systems, but to realize any gains you need
to consider many other factors besides the number of CPU's.
For instance, on a given system, if the processor is generally
idle much of the time due to a slow disk drive, then this system
is "input/output bound", and probably won't benefit from additional
processing power. If, on the other hand, a system has many
simultaneously executing processes, and CPU utilization is very
high, then you are likely to realize increased system performance.
SCSI disk drives can be very effective when used with multiple
processors, due to the way they can process multiple commands
without tying up the CPU. (<bf>C. Polisher</bf>)

<item> <bf>Do I get the same performance from 2-300 MHz processors
as from one 600 MHz processor?</bf>
<p>
This depends on the application, but most likely not.  SMP adds
some overhead that a faster uniprocessor box would not incur
(<bf>Wade Hampton</bf>).
<tt/:)/

<item> <bf>How does one display mutiple cpu performance?</bf>
<p>
Thanks to <bf>Samuel S. Chessman</bf>, here are some useful utilities:

<tag/Character based:/ <htmlurl

url="http://www.cs.inf.ethz.ch/~rauch/procps.html">

Basically, it's procps v1.12.2 (top, ps, et. al.)  and some patches to
support SMP.
<p>
For 2.2.x, <bf>Gregory R. Warnes</bf> as made a patch available at
<htmlurl name="http://queenbee.fhcrc.org/~warnes/procps"
url="http://queenbee.fhcrc.org/~warnes/procps"> 

<tag/Graphic:/
xosview-1.5.1 supports SMP. And kernels above 2.1.85 (included) the cpuX

</descrip>
<p>
By the way, you can't monitor processor scheduling precisely with xosview,
as xosview itself causes a scheduling perturbation. (<bf>H. Peter
Anvin</bf>)

<item> <bf>How can I enable more than 1 process for my kernel compile?</bf>
<p>
use:
<code>
        # make [modules|zImage|bzImages] MAKE="make -jX"
        where X=max number of processes.
        WARNING: This won't work for "make dep".
</code>
<p>
With a 2.2 like kernel, see also the file
<tt>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/smp.txt</> for specific instruction.
<p>
BTW, since running multiple compilers allows a machine with sufficient
memory to use use the otherwise wasted CPU time during I/O caused delays,
<tt>make MAKE="make -j 2" -j 2</> actually helps even on uniprocessor
boxes (from <bf>Ralf Bächle</bf>).

<item> <bf>Why is the time given by the <tt>time</> command inaccurate?</bf>
(from <bf>Joel Marchand</bf>)
<p>
In the 2.0 series, the result given by the <tt>time</> command is
false. The sum user+system is right *but* the spreading between user and
system time is false. 
<p>
More precisely: "The explanation is, that all time spent in processors
other than the boot cpu is accounted as system time.  If you time a
program, add the user time and the system time, then you timing will be
almost right, except for also including the system time that is
correctly accounted for" (<bf>Jakob Østergaard</bf>).
<p>
This bug is corrected in 2.2 kernels.

<sect1>SMP Programming
<p>
Section by <bf>Jakob Østergaard</bf>.

This section is intended to outline what works, and what doesn't when
it comes to programming multi-threaded software for SMP Linux.

<sect2>Parallelization methods
<p>
<enum>
<item> POSIX Threads
<item> PVM / MPI Message Passing Libraries
<item> fork() -- Multiple processes
</enum>

Since both fork() and PVM/MPI processes usually do not share memory,
but either communicate by means of IPC or a messaging API, they will
not be described further in this section. They are not very specific
to SMP, since they are used just as much - or more - on uniprocessor
computers, and clusters thereof.
<p>

Only POSIX Threads provide us with multiple threads sharing ressources
like - especially - memory. This is the thing that makes a SMP
machine special, allowing many processors to share their memory. To
use both (or more ;) processors of an SMP, use a kernel-thread
library. A good library is the <url name="LinuxThreads, a pthread
library made by Xavier Leroy"
url="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/linuxthreads/"> which is now
integrated with glibc2 (aka libc6).  Newer Linux distributions
include this library by default, hence you do not have to 
obtain a separate package to use kernel threads.
<p>
There are implementations of threads (and POSIX threads) that are
application-level, and do not take advantage of the kernel-threading.
These thread packages keep the threading in a single process, 
hence do not take advantage of SMP.  However, they are good for 
many applications and tend to actually run faster than kernel-threads
on single processor systems.
<p>
Multi-threading has never been really popular in the UN*X world
though. For some reason, applications requiring multiple processes or
threads, have mostly been written using fork(). Therefore, when using
the thread approach, one runs into problems of incompatible (not
thread-ready) libraries, compilers, and debuggers.  GNU/Linux is no
exception to this. Hopefully the next few sections will sched a little
light over what is currently possible, and what is not.


<sect2>The C Library
<p>
Older C libraries are not thread-safe. It is very important that you
use GNU LibC (<bf>glibc</bf>), also known as <bf>libc6</bf>. Earlier
versions are, of course possible to use, but it will cause you much more
trouble than upgrading your system will, well probably :)

If you want to use GDB to debug your programs, see below.

<sect2>Languages, Compilers and debuggers
<p>
There is a wealth of programming languages available for GNU/Linux,
and many of them can be made to use threads one way or the other
(some languages like Ada and Java even have threads as primitives in
the language).

This section will, however, currently only describe C and C++. If you
have experience in SMP Programming with other languages, please
enlighten us.

GNU C and C++, as well as the EGCS C and C++ compilers work with the
thread support from the standard C library (<bf>glibc</bf>). There are
however a few issues:
<p>
<enum>
<item> When compiling C or C++, use the <bf>-D_REENTRANT</bf> define
in the compiler command line. This is necessary to make certain
error-handling functions work like the errno variable.

<item> When using C++, If two threads throw exceptions concurrently, the
program will segfault.  The compiler does not generate thread-safe
exception code.

The workaround is to put a
pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;global_exception_lock) in the constructor(s) of
every class you throw(), and to put the corresponding
pthread_mutex_unlock(...) in the destructor.  It's ugly, but it works.
This solution was given by <bf>Markus Ferch</bf>.

</enum>

The GNU Debugger <bf>GDB</bf> as of version 4.18, should handle threads
correctly. Most Linux distribution offer a patched, thread-aware gdb.

It is not necessary to patch <bf>glibc</bf> in any way just to make it
work with threads. If you do not need to debug the software (this
could be true for all machines that are not development workstations),
there is no need to patch <bf>glibc</bf>.

Note that core-dumps are of no use when using multiple
threads. Somehow, the core dump is attached to one of the currently
running threads, and not to the program as a whole. Therefore,
whenever you are debugging anything, run it from the debugger.

<bf>Hint:</bf> If you have a thread running haywire, like eating 100%
CPU time, and you cannot seem to figure out why, here is a nice way to
find out what's going on: Run the program straight from the shell, no
GDB. Make the thread go haywire. Use <bf>top</bf> to get the PID of
the process.  Run GDB like <bf>gdb program pid</bf>. This will make
GDB attach itself to the process with the PID you specified, and stop
the thead. Now you have a GDB session with the offending thread, and
can use <bf>bt</bf> and the like to see what is happening.

<sect2>Other libraries
<P>
<bf>ElectricFence:</bf> This library is not thread safe. It should
be possible, however, to make it work in SMP environments by inserting
mutex locks in the ElectricFence code.

<p>
As far as library are concerned, there are:
<descrip>

<tag/OpenGL Mesa library/ Thanks to <bf>David Buccarelli</bf>,
<bf>Andreas Schiffler</bf> and <bf>Emil Briggs</bf>, it exists in a
multithreaded version (right now [1998-05-11], there is a working
version that provides speedups of 5-30% on some OpenGL benchmarks). The
multithreaded stuff is now included in the regular Mesa distribution as
an experimental option.  For more information, look at the

<sect>x86 architecture specific questions

<p>
<sect1>Why it doesn't work on my machine?

<p>
<enum>

<item> <bf>Can I use my Cyrix/AMD/non-Intel CPU in SMP?</bf>
<p>
<bf>Short answer:</bf> no.
<p>
<bf>Long answer:</bf> Intel claims ownership to the APIC SMP scheme, and
unless a company licenses it from Intel they may not use it. There are
currently no companies that have done so.  (This of course can change in
the future) FYI - Both Cyrix and AMD support the non-proprietary OpenPIC
SMP standard but currently there are no motherboards that use it.

<item> <bf>Why doesn't my old Compaq work?</bf>
<p>
 Put it into MP1.1/1.4 compliant mode.
<p>
check "Configure Hardware" -> "View / Edit details" -> "Advanced mode"
(F7 I think) for a configuration option "APIC mode" and set this to
"full Table mode". This is an official Compaq
recommandation. (<bf>Daniel Roesen</bf>)
<p>
(<bf>Adrian Portelli</bf>)To do this:
<enum>
  <item> Press F10 when the server boots to enter the System Configuration Utility
  <item> Press Enter to dismiss the splash screen
  <item> Immediately press CTRL+A
  <item> A message will appear informing you that you are now in "Advanced Mode"
  <item> Then select "Configure Hardware" -> "View / Edit details"
  <item> You will then see the advanced settings (intermixed with the ordinary ones)
  <item> Stroll down to "APIC Mode" and then select "Fully Mapped"
  <item> Save changes and reboot
</enum>

<item> <bf>Why doesnt my ALR work?</bf>
<p>
From <bf>Robert Hyatt</bf> : ALR Revolution quad-6 seems quite safe,
while some older revolution quad machines without P6 processors seem
"iffy"...
 
<item> <bf>Why does SMP go so slowly?</bf> or <bf>Why does one CPU show
a very low bogomips value while the first one is normal?</bf>
<p>
From <bf>Alan Cox</bf>: If one of your CPU's is reporting a very low
bogomips value the cache is not enabled on it. Your vendor probably
provides a buggy BIOS. Get the patch to work around this or better yet
send it back and buy a board from a competent supplier.
<p>
A 2.0 kernel (> 2.0.36) contains the MTRR patch which should solve this
problem (select option "Handle buggy SMP BIOSes with bad MTRR setup" in
the "General setup" menu).
<p>
I think buggy SMP BIOS handling is automatic in latest 2.2 kernels.

<item> <bf>I've heard IBM machines have problems</bf>

<p>
Some IBM machines have the MP1.4 bios block in the EBDA, allowed but not
supported below 2.2 kernels.

There is an old 486SLC based IBM SMP box. Linux/SMP requires hardware
FPU support.

<item> <bf>Is there any advantage of Intel MP 1.4 over 1.1 specification?</bf>
<p>
Nope (according to Alan <tt/:)/ ), 1.4 is just a stricker specs of 1.1.

<item> <bf>Why does the clock drift so rapidly when I run linux SMP?</bf>
<p> 
This is known problem with IRQ handling and long kernel locks in
the 2.0 series kernels.  Consider upgrading to a later 2.2 kernel.
<p>
From <bf>Jakob Oestergaard</bf>: Or, consider running xntpd. That should
keep your clock right on time.  (I think that I've heard that enabling
RTC in the kernel also fixes the clock drift. It works for me! but I'm
not sure whether that's general or I'm just being lucky)

<p>
There are some kernel fixes in the later 2.2.x series that may 
fix this.
<p>

<item> <bf>Why are my CPU's numbered 0 and 2 instead of 0 and 1 (or some other odd
numbering)?</bf>
<p>
The CPU number is assigned by the MB manufacturer and doesn't mean
anything.  Ignore it.


<item> <bf>My quad-Xeon system hangs as soon as it has decompressed the
 kernel</bf>
<p>
(<bf>Doug Ledford</bf>) Try recompiling LILO with LARGE_EBDA support
and then making sure to always use make bzImage when compiling the
kernel.  That appears to have fixed the SMP boot hangs here on Intel
multi-Xeon boards.  However, please note that this also appears to break
LILO in that the root= option no longer works, so make sure you rdev
your kernel image at the same time you run lilo to make sure that the
kernel loads the correct root filesystem at boot.
<p>
(<bf>Robert M. Hyatt</bf>) With 3 cpus, do you have a terminator in the
4th slot?

<item> <bf>During boot machine hang signaling an IOAPIC problem</bf>
<p>
Try boot options "noapic" (<bf>John Aldrich</bf>) and/or "reboot=bios" (<bf>Terry Shull</bf>).

<item> <bf>My system locks up during heavy NFS traffic</bf>
<p>
Try the later 2.2.x kernels and the knfsd patches.  This is 
currently under investigation. (<bf>Wade Hampton</bf>)

<p>
<item> <bf>My system locks up with no oops messages</bf>
<p>
If you are using kernels 2.2.11 or 2.2.12, get the latest kernel. For
example 2.2.13 has a number of SMP fixes.  Several people have reported
these kernels to be unstable for SMP.  These same kernels may have NFS
problems that can cause lockups.  Also, use a serial console to capture
your oops messages. (<bf>Wade Hampton</bf>)
<p>
If the problem remains (and the other suggestions on this list didn't
help either), then you could try the latest 2.3 kernels. They have more
verbose (and more robust) SMP/APIC code, and automatic
hard-lockup-prevention code which will produce meaningful oopses instead
of a silent hang. (<bf>Ingo Molnar</bf>)
<p>
(<bf>Osamu Aoki</bf>) You MUST also <em>disable</em> all BIOS related
power save features.  Example of good configuration (Dual Celeron 466
Abit BP6):
<code>
 POWER MANAGEMENT SETUP.
   ACPI:              Disabled
   POWER MANAGEMENT:  Disabled
   PM CONTROL by APM: No
</code>
If power management features are activated, some random freeze can occur.

<item> <bf>Debugging lockups</bf>
<p>
(item by <bf>Wade Hampton</bf>)
<p>
A good means of debugging lockups is to get the ikd patch from

<p>
There are several of debug options, but do NOT use the 
soft lockup option!  For newer SMP boxes,
turn kernel debugging then turn on the NMI oopser.  
To verify that the NMI oopser is working, after booting the 
new kernel, 
<tt>/cat /proc/interrupts</> and verify that you are getting
NMIs.  When the box locks up, you should get an OOPS.
<p>
You may also try the %eip option.  This allows the kernel
to print on the console the %eip address every time a kernel function
is called.  When the box locks up, write down the first column 
ordered by the second column then lookup the addresses in the 
System.map file.  This works only in console mode.
<p>
Also note that the use of a serial console can greatly facilitate
debugging kernel lockups, not just SMP kernel lockups!

<item> <bf>"APIC error interrupt on CPU#n, should never happen" messages
in logs</bf>
<p>
A message like:
<code>
APIC error interrupt on CPU#0, should never happen.
... APIC ESR0: 00000002
... APIC ESR1: 00000000
</code>
indicates a 'receive checksum error'. This cannot be caused by Linux as
the APIC message checksumming part is completely in hardware. It might
be marginal hardware. As long as you dont see any instability, they are
not a problem - APIC messages are retried until delivered. (<bf>Ingo
Molnar</bf>)

<sect1>Possible causes of crash

<p>
In this section you'll find some <bf>possible</bf> reasons for a crash
of an SMP machine (credits are due to <bf>Jakob Østergaard</bf> for
this part). As far as I (David) know, theses problems are Intel
specific.

<p>
<itemize>

<item> <bf>Cooling problems</bf>
<p>
From <bf>Ralf Bächle</bf>: [Related to case size and fans]
It's important that the air is flowing.  It of course can't where cables
etc. are preventing this like in too small cases.  On the other side
I've seen oversized cases causing big problems.  There are some tower
cases on the market that actually are worse for cooling than desktops.
In short, the right thing is thinking about aerodynamics in the case.
Extra cases for hot peripherals are usefull as well.  
<p>
Of course you can always go to Radio Shack (or similar) and get another fan.
You can use the lm_sensors to monitor the CPU temperature of newer PII
and PIII processors.  This might help you to determine if heat is 
a problem. (<bf>Wade Hampton</bf>)


<item> <bf>Bad memory</bf>
<p>
Don't buy cheap RAM and don't use mixed RAM modules on a motherboard
that is picky about it.
<p>
Especially Tyan motherboards are known to be picky about RAM speed (see
the Tyan paragraph below for a possible solution).

<p>
There have been some report of 10ns PC100 RAM being sold with 
motherboards where the CPU really needs 8ns RAM. (<bf>Wade Hampton</bf>)


<item> <bf>Bad combination of different stepping CPUs</bf>
<p>
Check <tt>/proc/cpuinfo</> to see that your CPUs are same stepping.

<item> <bf>If your system is unstable, then DON'T overclock it!</bf>
<p>
...and even if it is stable, DON'T overclock.
<p>
From <bf>Ralf Bächle</bf>: Overclocking causes very subtle
problems.  I have a nice example, one of my overclocked old machines
misscomputes a couple of pixels of a 640 x 400 fractal.  The problem is
only visible when comparing them using tools. So better say <em>never,
nuncas, jamais, niemals</em> overclock.


<item> <bf>2.0.x kernel and fast ethernet</bf> (from <bf>Robert G. Brown</bf>)
<p>
2.0.x kernels on high performance fast ethernet systems have significant
(and known) problems with a race/deadlock condition in the networking
interrupt handler.
<p>
The solution is to get the latest 100BT development drivers from <url
name="CESDIS Linux Ethernet device drivers site"
url="http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/"> (ones that define
SMPCHECK).

<item> <bf>A bug in the 440FX chipset</bf> (from <bf>Emil Briggs</bf>) 
<p>
If you had a system using the 440FX chipset then your problem with the
lockups was possibly due to a documented errata in the chipset.  Here is
a reference
<p>

<p>
The problem can be fixed with a BIOS workaround (Or a kernel patch) and
in fact David Wragg wrote a patch that's included with Richard Gooch's
MTTR patch. For more information and a fix look here:

<item> <bf>If the machine reboots/freezes after a while, there can be two good
    BIOS + memory related reasons</bf> (from <bf>Jakob Østergaard</bf>)
  <itemize>
  <item> If the BIOS has settings like "memory hole at 16M" and/or
    "OS/2 memory > 64MB", try disabling them both. Linux does
    not always react well with theese options.
  <item> If you have more than 64 MB of memory in the machine, and you
    specified the exact number manually in the LILO configuration, 
    you should specify one MB less than you actually have in the
    machine.  If you have 128 MB, you lilo.conf line looks like:
    append="mem=127M"
  </itemize>


<item> <bf>Be aware of IRQ related problems</bf>
<p>
Sometime, some cards are not recognized or can trigger IRQ
conflicts. Try shuffling cards on slots in different ways and 
possibly moving them to different IRQs.
<p>
Contributed by <bf>hASCII</bf> : removing an " append="hisax=9,2,3""
line in lilo.conf allowed using a kernel from the 2.1.xx series with
activated ISDN + Hisax support. Kernels from the 2.0.xx series doesn't
make problems like this.
<p>
Try also to set BIOS setup option like "MP 1.4 mode" or "route PCI
interrupts through IOAPIC", or "OS Type" not set to DOS neither

<item> <bf>Floppy access while sound is active</bf>

If you lockup when trying to access the floppy (for example
while sound is playing) you may have to edit drivers/pci/quirks.c 
and set <tt>/int isa_dma_bridge_buggy = 1;</>

<p>
<em>Please note</em>: Some more specific information can be found with

<sect2>Motherboards with known problems


<p>
<itemize>
<item> none right now
</itemize>


<sect1>Low cost SMP Linux box (dual Celeron box)
<p>
(<bf>Stéphane Écolivet</bf>)
<p>

The lowest cost SMP Linux boxes with nowadays buyable processors are
dual Celeron systems. Such a system is not officially possible 
according to Intel.  Better think about the second generation of 
Celeron, those with 128 Kb L2 cache.

<sect2>Is it possible to run a dual Intel Celeron box ?
<p>
<bf>Official answer from Intel:</bf> no, Celeron cannot work in SMP mode.
<p>
<bf>Practical answer:</bf> it is possible, but requires hardware
alteration for Slot 1 processors.  Alteration is described by Tomohiro
Kawada on his <url name="Dual Celeron System"
url="http://kikumaru.w-w.ne.jp/pc/celeron/index_e.html"> page.  Of
course, this kind of modification removes warranties...  Some versions
of Celeron processor are also available in Socket 370 format.  In that
case, alteration may just be done on the Socket 370 to Slot 1 adapter or
may even be sold pre-wired for SMP use. (<bf>Andy Poling</bf>, <bf>Hans
- Erik Skyttberg</bf>, <bf>James Beard</bf>)
<p>
There is also a motherboard (ABIT BP6) allowing two Celerons in Socket
370 format to be inserted (<bf>Martijn Kruithof</bf>, <bf>Ryan
McCue</bf>). ABIT Computer BP6 verified tested and native to linux with
dual ppga socket 370 (<bf>Andre Hedrick</bf>).

<sect2>How does Linux behave on a dual Celeron system ?
<p>
Fine, thank you.

<sect2>Celeron processors are known to be easily overclockable. And dual
Celeron system ?
<p>
It <bf>may</bf> work. However, overclocking this kind of system is not
as easy as overclocking a mono-processor one. It is definitly not a good
idea for a production system. For personal use, dual Celeron 300A
systems running rock-solid at 450 MHz have been reported. (<bf>numerous
people</bf>)

<sect2>And making a quad Celeron system ?
<p>
It is impossible. Celeron processors have nearly the same features as
basic Pentium II chips.  If you want more than 2 processors in your
system, you'll have to look at Pentium Pro, Pentium II Xeon or Pentium
III (?) boxes.


<sect2>What about mixing Celeron and Pentium II processor ?
<p>
A system using a "re-enable" Celeron processor and a Pentium II
processor with the same steppings <bf>may theorically</bf> work.
<p>
<bf>Alexandre Charbey</bf> as made such a system:
<itemize>
<item> Asus P2B-D motherboard, proc 1: Celeron 366, proc 2: Pentium II
400@266
<item> 66Mhz and 75Mhz bus frenquencies where functionnal
<item> the fastest processor (in this case the Celeron) should be put on
the second slot. Swapping processors (fatest first) leads to quick
failure. 
</itemize>

<sect>Sparc architecture specific questions
<p>

<sect1>Which Sparc machines are supported ?
<p>
Quoting the <url name="UltraLinux" url="http://ultra.linux.cz/"> web
page (only SMP systems):
<itemize>
<item> UltraSPARC PCI based workstations: Ultra60, Ultra450
<item> UltraSPARC SBUS based servers: Enterprise 1, 2, 150 
<item> UltraSPARC SBUS based large servers: Enterprise 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 10000 
<item> UltraSPARC PCI based servers: Enterprise 250, 450 
<item> SPARC sun4m SMP machines (<bf>Anton Blanchard</bf>)
</itemize>

UltraLinux has ran on a 14 CPUs machine (see the <url name="dmesg
output" url="http://lwn.net/1998/1210/a/dm-sparc.html">).

<sect1>Specific problem related to Sparc SMP support
<p>
(<bf>David Miller</bf>) 
There should not be any worries.

The only known problem, and one we don't intend to fix, is that if you
build an SMP kernel for 32-bit (ie. non-ultrasparc) systems, this kernel
will not work on sun4c systems.

<sect1>SMP specific limit with current kernel (2.2)
<p>
(<bf>David Miller</bf>) There is a bug in the include/linux/tasks.h
header file, it needs to define NR_CPUS to 64 on UltraSparc as this is
the upper limit for the hardware we support :-)

<sect>PowerPC architecture specific questions
<p>

<sect1>Which PPC machines are supported ?
<p>
<itemize>
<item> PowerSurge boards (including UMAX s900)
<item> PowerMac
<item> Motorola MTX: support under developement. Patches not yet
integrated into the main kernel (<bf>Troy Benjegerdes</bf>)
</itemize>

(<bf>Cort Dougan</bf>) Not supported: PPC RS/6000 systems


<sect1>Specific problem related to PPC SMP support
<p>
Nothing. Usual SMP compiling (see above). As usual, be aware, modules
are specific either for UP or SMP. Recompile them. (<bf>Paul
Mackerras</bf>) 

<sect>Alpha architecture specific questions
<p>

<sect1>Which Alpha machines are supported ?
<p>
(<bf>Geerten Kuiper</bf>) SMP works for most, if not all, AXP servers.

(<bf>Jay A Estabrook</bf>) SMP does seem to work on most of our [Compaq]
boxes with 2 or more CPUs. That includes :
<itemize>
<item> AS2000/2100 (SABLE)
<item> AS4000/4100 (RAWHIDE)
<item> DS20 (DP264)
</itemize>

It does not include :
<itemize>
<item> AS2100A (LYNX)
<item> TurboLaser bigboys (8200/8400)
</itemize>

(<bf>Alpha Processor Inc</bf>) SMP support has been qualified for all API
SMP systems starting from later 2.2-series kernels (approximately kernel
2.2.7). 
At the time of writing, that is :
<itemize>
<item> DP264
<item> UP2000
</itemize>

API's support website can be found
<url name="here." url="http://www.alpha-processor.com/support/index.shtml">

<sect1>Specific problem related to Alpha SMP support
<p>
None (really ? :-)
