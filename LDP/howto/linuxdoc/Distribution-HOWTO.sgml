<title>The Linux Distribution HOWTO
<author>Eric S. Raymond &lt;esr@thyrsus.com&gt;
<date>v6.8, 8 February 2000

<abstract>
This document is intended to help new users choose a Linux distribution,
and to help experienced users track the state of the Linux market.  It
does not aim to be a complete list of Linux distributions for all
platforms, but instead focuses on leading English-language Intel
distributions available on CD-ROM and accessible to Linux novices.
</abstract>

<toc>

<sect>Introduction
<p>
	There is no single distribution of the Linux software. Instead,
	there are many such distributions, available both via anonymous FTP
	and by mail order on CD-ROM.

	The purpose of this document is to provide short summaries of the
	English-language Linux CD-ROM distributions, and to provide
	pointers for the reader to find more information.  A German
	Distributions HOWTO was formerly maintained by Marco Budde but
	seems to have disappeared.  We are not aware of any distributions
	in languages other than English and German.

	The information presented here is not complete; there are other
	Linux distributions than are listed here.  By the nature of open
	source software, anyone that changes anything in their Linux
	installation and makes it available to others somehow is `a
	distribution'. A document such as this has to pick somewhere to
	draw the line.  I have picked `available on CD'. This is by no
	means the definition of a Linux distribution.  There are numerous
	small distributions that offer things the big distros don't, not
	the least of which is smallness itself.

	The information presented here is not complete; there are other
	Linux distributions than are listed here. If you are associated
	with a CD-ROM distribution we don't list, please see
	<ref id="submissions" name="Submissions To This Document">
	near the end of this document
	for information on making a submission.  It's easy and should take
	less then five minutes.

	For a more complete list of distributions (albeit with sparser
	information on each) see the <url name="Linux HQ Distributions List"
	url="http://www.linuxhq.com/dist-index.html">.

	<bf/Disclaimer:/ We make absolutely <em/no/ guarantee as to the
	correctness of the information, prices, and ordering details given
	in this document. Check the last-modified field of each to get an
	idea of its currency, then go to the vendor's web page for
	up-to-date information.  Furthermore, unless otherwise stated the
	Linux software comes with <em/ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY/.

	Your editor tries to stick to facts in most of this HOWTO, but he
	has some opinions on the state of the Linux market.  If you care
	what they are, you can read them under <ref id="opinions"
	name="Editorial Recommendations">.

	<bf/Disclosure:/ I (esr) have no financial connection to any Linux
	vendor, nor have I accepted any renumeration or perquisites from
	any vendor other than free product for review (and one T-shirt from
	Red Hat).

	Eric S. Raymond, <tt/esr@snark.thyrsus.com/.  Please do <em/not/
	send me general Linux questions or requests for help in
	choosing a distribution unless you're willing to hire me at
	normal consulting rates; I don't have time to deal with them,
	and I try to put everything I know about choosing a
	distribution in this document.

<sect1>Recent Changes
<p>
	Yggdrasil Plug-And-Play and Craftworks Linux seem no longer to be
	available for sale, and have been dropped.  DOSLINUX has also been
	dropped due to its specialist nature.  KRUD, Linux-Mandrake, and
	LinuxGT have been added.

<sect1>Overview of the Linux Market
<p>
	In the beginning (say, 1993), a Linux distribution was something
	you downloaded off the Internet onto floppies.  Installation was a
	laborious process and repeated frustrations due to bad media were
	common.

	Then came cheap CD-ROM drives and the CD-ROM, a medium ideally
	suited for shipping large volumes of operating-system software
	cheaply.  There's a whole mini-industry now built around commercial
	CD-ROM Linuxes, and (because the vendors have actual cash flow to
	fund support and marketing) they increasingly dominate the Linux
	world.  Debian is now the only significant non-commercial release,
	and even it seems to be propagated largely by shovelware CD-ROMs.

	Most of the CD-ROM distributions (including Slackware, Yggdrasil and
	Red Hat) are still available for FTP from the home sites of their
	developers.  But if you have a CD-ROM drive and a few dollars, you
	will have many more distributions and more support options to
	choose from (and you'll usually get some useful paper
	documentation).  For more on the details of installation, see
	the Linux Installation HOWTO,
	<url url="http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO.html">.

	Prices for CD-ROM distributions of Intel Linuxes start at
	&dollar;20 and top out at a whole &dollar;50 (and the extra few
	dollars can buy real value).  Many vendors sell subscription deals
	that will lower your cost-per-CD for regular updates over the
	subscription period.

	Price correlates with features and quality pretty well (as one
	would expect in a very competitive market).  Your editor recommends
	paying the few extra dollars for a top-drawer original CD-ROM
	distribution; this will pay off in fewer installation and
	administration hassles down the road.

	Making good choices is much simpler than it used to be.  In 1995-96
	the Linux market underwent a serious shakeout, with a very few
	commercial distributions emerging as leaders while weaker ones
	disappeared or stagnated.  The toll among general-purpose
	non-commercial distributions has been even fiercer; essentially,
	only Debian survives in this role.

	As a result, the three-tier structure of primary distribution
	builders, value-added repackagers, and bottom-feeding CD shovellers
	that used to define the market has nearly collapsed.  To be
	competitive in 1997, a Linux outfit (whether commercial or
	noncommercial) has to offer reasonable support and behave like a
	primary distribution builder, whether it's really one or not. So
	as long as you look for a recent freeze date, it is pretty hard to
	get stuck with a dud distribution these days.

<sect1>Editorial Recommendations<label id=opinions>
<p>
	Last section, the facts.  In this section, my opinions (for
	whatever they're worth -- and remember the caveat about free
	advice).  There is no substitute for doing your own evaluation
	based on experience and the data in this guide, and these are
	intended more to illuminate my possible biases than as a guide to
	what you should do.

	From the beginnings of the Linux CD-ROM industry in 1993 to Fall
	1995, Yggdrasil was the king of the hill -- it essentially founded
	the CD-ROM market and then set the standard for everybody else.  I
	used Yggdrasil, and I recommended it over commercial System V
	versions for its superior documentation, large collection of
	applications, and enlightened policy of sending free releases to
	freeware authors and dedicating part of the price of each CD-ROM to
	financially supporting free software.  But Yggdrasil hasn't issued
	a new release since 1995 and they've been left behind by the
	market.

	I now run Red Hat Linux and am quite satisfied with it.  Red Hat's
	RPM technology currently gives it, IMO, a technical edge over any
	other vendor.  They've made most of the right moves at the right
	times and I consider them the current market leader.

	If you're ideologically wedded to using a non-commercial distribution,
	Debian seems to me to be the clear choice, the only one left with
	a serious support team behind it. 

	These opinions should certainly not be interpreted as an
	unconditional endorsement; different Linux distributions are
	optimized for different needs, and yours may well be best served by
	some other distribution (especially if, unlike me, you're mainly a
	DOS user and are looking for a distribution tuned for dual-boot
	systems and being launched from DOS).

	Furthermore, industry standing is volatile.  By the time you read
	this, Red Hat or Debian may well have fallen off their games and
	been displaced by hungrier newcomers.

<sect>Distributions
<p>
	All these distributions are available on CD-ROM (some of the
	non-commercial ones only show up on network-archive snapshots).
	Most of these are available for free over the network (but the
	commercial ones won't support you if you buy this way).  They are
	custom-assembled, rather than just being re-packagings of a
	pre-existing network release.

	They are listed in alphabetical order.

<tag/Provider's Description:/

	Caldera is shipping OpenLinux 1.2 in a three-tiered family of 
	products: OpenLinux Lite, OpenLinux Base, and OpenLinux Standard.

	OpenLinux Lite is a freely available evaluation of the OpenLinux
	product (it includes a 90-day evalutation of the Caldera integrated 
	Desttop--the full licensed version of the desktop is included in the 
	Base and Standard products). OpenLinxu Lite can be downloaded from
	Caldera's ftp site, or obtainded on CD for the cost of shipping. It
	is also designed for use by book and software publishers to provide
	a commercially stable Linux offering with their books and software 
	products.

	OpenLinux Base contains everything that is in Lite plus it is a 
	complete, easy-to-install Linux operating system, with integrated
	Desktop, Internet client and server components, and Intranet 
	connectivity. OpenLinux Base includes Netscape Navigator and full
	documentation.

	OpenLinux Standard includes what is in Base plus more high-end, name
	brand, commercial software components (such as Netscape FastTrack Web
	Server, Netscape Navigator Gold Web browser and authoring tools, 
	ADABAS D database, StarOffice productivity suite, Caldera OpenDOS, and
	NetWare client and administration tools).

	All three tiers of the OpenLinux 1.2 release are currently available.

	With Caldera OpenLinux, you can see a whole world of powerful
	new computing, even the power of a UNIX workstation on your PC!
	By using a Linux kernel, OpenLinux gives you speed and stability
	that compare to systems costing thousands of dollars. Open Linux
	also gives you: 
<itemize>
<item>	Real multi-tasking runs many text or graphical applications at
	once; no application can cause another to crash, unlike less robust
	systems. 
<item>	The Linux 2.0 kernel gives super-fast TCP/IP access to the
	Internet, plus loadable device drivers, for the most efficient use
	of your system resources. 
<item>	Easy-to-follow, quick installation with menu-based choices and
	auto-detection of your hardware make installation a snap on most
	systems. The Getting Started Guide (included) provides a
	step-by-step illustrated procedure, with troubleshooting tips.
</itemize>

	No other Linux system includes a complete, integrated desktop
	interface with configuration tools and graphical editor. Its
	powerful drag-and-drop capabilities come pre-configured with
	thousands of icons and application settings. The Desktop provides a
	convenient place where you can store your favorite programs and
	data files for instant access. The Desktop gives you:

<itemize>
<item>	Drag-and-drop launching of programs with data files. 
<item>	An integrated graphical text editor. 
<item>	Easy access to an array of powerful system configuration tools. 
<item>	A configurable icon bar, custom layouts, and preference settings. 
<item>	Powerful file management using drag-and-drop or graphical dialogs. 
</itemize>

<tag/Provider's Description:/

	Debian Linux is the result of a volunteer effort to create a
	high-quality non-commercial Linux distribution.  Debian Linux 2.0
	is a complete and fully-functional Unix-compatible operating system
	for the personal computer.  The system uses ELF executables and
	libc6 (unlikeprevious Debian versions, which used libc5).  At
	present, Debian Linux is available for the IBM PC architecture
	(386/486/Pentium) and m68k, with versions for Sparc and Alpha
	promised for 2.1.  ARM, PPC, and UltraSparc ports are underway.

	Debian Linux is an easy-to-upgrade distribution that mostly
	consists of freely redistributable software from a number of
	different sources and systems.  Support for shadow passwords is
	available, although it should be considered experimental in the 1.1
	release.  Non-free packages may also obtained, making Debian a
	well-rounded system.

	The benefits of Debian Linux are its upgradability, well-defined
	dependencies between packages, and its open development.  It is the
	only distribution of Linux that is being developed co-operatively
	by many individuals through the Internet, in the same spirit as
	Linux and other open-source operating systems.  More than 400
	package maintainers are working on over 1500 packages and improving
	Debian Linux.  A sophisticated bug tracking system allows users to
	easily report bugs and security concerns which are quickly dealt
	with by the Debian community.  A new release of the package will
	soon occur on well-known ftp archives.

	Debian Linux is a very dynamic distribution.  Snap-shot releases
	are made about every three months, the ftp archives are updated
	daily.  

	For more information about Debian Linux, please refer to the
	files at <url url="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/"> or visit our
	World Wide Web page at <url url="http://www.debian.org/">.

	If you're interested in joining this project you are invited to
	subscribe to either debian-user@lists.debian.org or
	debian-devel@lists.debian.org by sending a mail to
	debian-user-request@lists.debian.org (or debian-devel-request
	respectively) with the word "help" in the subject line.

<tag/Internet Access:/ 
	Debian Linux is available via anonymous FTP from <url

<tag/Provider's Description:/
	The charter of the WGS Linux Pro CD is different from all other 
	distributions currently on the market.  We are actively
	pursuing penetration into the commercial marketplace for Linux.
	Everything we do is aimed at increasing the size of the Linux
	community, and helping Linux to become THE one true operating 
	system, not just an operating system.

	WGS Linux Pro consists of our Main "Stable" Linux CD, for which
	we select what we consider to be the best Linux distribution 
	available.  Then we make bug fixes &amp; minor enhancements.  This 
	CD often contains software older than the latest, under the theory 
	that "the latest is not always the greatest".  Together with this 
	approach we provide technical support as well as support agreements.  
	For this reason WGS Linux Pro is considered a primary Linux 
	distribution.  Optionally, and in addition to our primary CD, we 
	supply supplemental CDs containing all the latest Linux software
	(including current archives of the tsx-11, metalab, and Red Hat
	sites).  Virtually anything you will get with anyone's Linux
	product can be found on these supplemental CDs.  We continually add
	more to these supplemental CDs as software becomes available.  Even
	with all this, pricing on our product line is very favorable when
	correctly compared to other Linux distributions.  Also optional
	(included with Linux Pro+) is a professionally produced and printed
	manual containing the Linux documentation project and more!

	Current version is 4.0a; kernel is 1.2.13 with installable 2.0.x
	on the CD.

<tag/Internet Access:/
	Look in <url url="http://www.wgs.com"> for a list of WGS products,
	and latest information on the CD-ROM.

<tag/Ordering:/
	WGS Linux Pro is available on CD from dealers and distributors
	worldwide, and soon from our FTP site.

	You may call, fax, email, or mail us, to purchase, or request
	additional information.  We will be happy to respond to any
	question you have.  We accept American Express, Visa, Discover, and
	MasterCard, or purchase orders with approval of credit.

<tag/Miscellaneous:/
	Complete information is available on our FTP site.

	WGS publishes a free E-Mail newsletter on Linux and FlagShip 
	to which you may subscribe by just emailing us your request.

	In addition we carry Motif, FlagShip, A line of books, and 
	other products to make your experience with Linux more complete
	and fulfilling.  Check us out!

<tag/Provider's Description:/
	Red Hat 6.1 is based on the 2.2 kernel and is available for
	Intel, Sparc and Alpha platforms.

	Four installation innovations make Red Hat the easiest Linux to
	install ever.  Our graphical installation mode brings you straight
	up into X for most of the installation.  Our boot disk creation script
	eases selection of the proper boot disk, and it saves your existing
	network configuration information and XF86Config so you don't have to
	configure TCP/IP or X!  Our FTP install allows you to install simply
	by downloading 3 floppy disk images -- the rest is done automatically!
	And finally, the installation includes seamless support for PCMCIA
	devices -- install Red Hat on your laptop as easily as on your
	desktop machine!

	After installing Red Hat Linux once, you will never need to reinstall
	Linux again!  The new RPM packaging system is sophisticated enough to
	allow upgrading to new Red Hat releases without reinstalling your
	system - no partitioning, no backing up all your files, no headaches.

<tag/Ordering:/
	Available directly from Red Hat Software and most distributors
	of Linux related products.  Please contact Red Hat Software for
	ordering details (on-line ordering is available through Red Hat's
	Web).  Suggested retail price for the Standard version is

	The big selling point of this distribution is RPM, the Red Hat
	Package Manager.  This piece of software is a remarkable advance;
	it allows you to cleanly install and de-install applications and
	operating-system components, including the kernel and OS base
	itself.  RPM is now used as well by essentially all other
	distributions except Debian.

<sect>Submissions To This Document<label id="submissions">
<p>
	I encourage anyone and everyone who maintains a Linux distribution
	or mail order service, to submit information on their service to
	this HOWTO. It's easy and fun, and it's free advertising. This
	document is posted to many places and is archived (see the next
	section).

<sect1>Types of Submissions
<p>
	We are interested in submissions for: 

	<itemize>
 	<item>Complete distributions of Linux software available on CD-ROM.
	    (We no longer carry FTP-only distributions, as this document is
	    aimed primarily at new users for which they are not appropriate.)
	    By `complete distribution' we mean any set of software which can be
	    used to build a complete Linux system from scratch.

	<item>Layered products or individual software packages available only
	    via mail order. If your software package is available via
	    anonymous FTP, chances are people can find it. Software products
	    only available via mail-order include commercial things such as
	    Motif, and any other commercial software ported to Linux.

	<item>Any other <em/Linux-specific/ goods available via mail order, 
	    such as Linux-specific books and documentation, T-shirts, and 
	    assorted paraphrenalia.   Note: our interest in the latter
	    categories is marginal -- this is a Linux Distributions HOWTO,
	    not a catalogue of cutesy Linux junk.  Whatever you're
	    selling will have to be (a) very useful, (b) very original, or
	    (c) very funny, to get listed here.
	</itemize>

	If the number of submissions for services and layered products
	is large, I'll create a separate HOWTO for these items. 

<sect1>How to submit
<p>
	To submit an entry to this HOWTO, please send mail to 
	<tt/esr@snark.thyrsus.com/ with the following information. This 
	format is not machine-parsable; any of the fields may be any
	length that you wish, but I'd like to keep each entry down to,
	say, 50 lines.

<descrip>
<tag/Name:/
	<em/Name of service or distribution/

<tag/Distributor:/
	<em>Name of company, person, etc. who distributes/maintains
	the service or distribution.  Should include mail, email,
	phone contact information, and (if possible) a WWW reference.</em>

<tag/Provider's Description:/
	<em>Description of the distribution or service 
	that you provide. If this is a software distribution, please include 
	information such as what software is included, versions, general 
	overview of installation, requirements, and so on.</em>

<tag/Internet Access:/
	<em>Where your service or distribution is 
	available over the Internet; typically a WWW or FTP address.</em>

<tag/Ordering:/
	<em>How to order your distribution or service, if 
	applicable. Include prices, shipping information, methods of 
	payment, etc.</em>

<tag/Support:/
	Information on support terms and support contracts.

<tag/Miscellaneous:/
	<em>Anything else that you find relevant.</em>

<tag/Last Freeze Date:/
	Last freeze date of the current version(s).  Also, your estimated
	update frequency.
</descrip>

<sect1>Submission Guidelines
<p>
	Please keep your entry as short as possible. If you need to include
	extensive information, please make a reference to where one can FTP
	or mail to get more information on your distribution; these entries
	are only meant to be <em/pointers/ to where one can find information
	on your service or distribution. 

	If you provide more than one service or distribution, please use 
	<em/separate entries/ for each.

	I may edit your entries for conciseness and brevity, if I find 
	any irrelevant information, or if the entry is overly verbose. 
	Otherwise the content should remain the same.

	When making submissions to the Distribution-HOWTO, you grant implicit
	permission for me to use the entries in other materials, such as books 
	from the LDP, and other online documents. For example, information
	from the Distribution-HOWTO may be included in a published Linux book.
	If you do not want me to include your entry in materials other than
	the Distribution-HOWTO, please say so.

<sect1> Terms of Use
<p>
	This document is copyright 1997 by Eric S. Raymond. You may use,
	disseminate, and reproduce it freely, provided you:

<itemize>
<item>Do not omit or alter this copyright notice.
<item>Do not omit or alter or omit the version number and date.
<item>Do not omit or alter the document's pointer to the current WWW version.
<item>Clearly mark any consdensed, altered or versions as such. 
</itemize>

	These restrictions are intended to protect potential readers from
	stale or mangled versions.  If you think you have a good case for
	an exception, ask me.

<sect1>Acknowledgements
<p>
	This document was originated by Bill Riemers.  Matt Welsh
	maintained the second version.  Erik Troan then maintained
	the document to release 3.0.
<p>
	In January 1995, Eric Raymond, while unaware of the existence of
	this document, began to develop a similar FAQ in the format
	of his now-discontinued "PC-clone UNIX Software Buyer's
	Guide", which had covered mainly System V UNIXes and BSD/OS.
<p>
	In March 1995, Eric approached Erik about cooperating on a merged
	version.  In early April 1995, Erik went to work for Red Hat
	Software, and (wishing to avoid a conflict of interest) handed the
	document to Eric.  Eric merged in a lot of new information and
	added several new fields to the distribution entries.
<p>
	Accordingly, this document has been a sort of serial collaboration.
	The editorial `we' generally tags observations by all the
	maintainers; `I' is Eric (the current one) speaking.
<p>
	We are delighted to acknowledge the contributions of all the
	Linux users and Internet hackers who have contributed information
	and feedback.
