<sect>Procedure
<p>
Get a set of ttf fonts from M$, or some fonts of your own, or 
just use your windows partition if you have one and do the 
following as root at the command line:

<em>
<bf>IF</bf> you are using something else than the windows partition method, 
line 2 will of course differ. 
</em>

<itemize>
<item><tt>mkdir /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Truetype</tt>
<item><tt>cp /winpartition/windows/fonts/*.ttf /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Truetype</tt>
<item><tt>cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Truetype</tt>
<item><tt>ttmkfdir &gt; fonts.scale</tt>
<item><tt>mkfontdir</tt>
</itemize>

<p>
There you go. You will now have all TrueType fonts working. If you want
to add fonts, just move/copy those [*.ttf files] into the aforementioned
directory, and repeat the process starting from line 3. 

Netscape has problems with these fonts, it somehow doesn't scale them. 
Mozilla has no such problems. Opera neither.

Both the <tt>ttmkfdir</tt> and the <tt>mkfontdir</tt> executables
should be included with your XFree 4.0.x distribution.
