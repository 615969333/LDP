<sect1>Credits
<p>
I'd like to thank Bear Giles for his Debian TTF howto which brought
me on the right path :o).

Of course, credit should also go to the XFree86 crew for the enormous effort of maintaining XFree86, and Joerg Pommnitz for writing <tt>ttmkfdir</tt>.

Also I'd like to pass a BIG big thank you to the LDP for building and
maintaining a network of helping hands which already guided many
people through the hard to overcome the learning curve Linux has.

Thanks to Joe Meadows for notifying me that this howto probably described 
an illegal act in version 0.0.2 and earlier.

<sect>Procedure
<p>
Get a set of TrueType fonts (for example from one of the many sites
making fonts availiable for download) and do the following as 
root at the command line:

<itemize>
<item><tt>mkdir /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Truetype</tt>
<item><tt>cp /home/joeuser/yourdownloaddirectory/*.ttf /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Truetype</tt>
<item><tt>cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Truetype</tt>
<item><tt>ttmkfdir &gt; fonts.scale</tt>
<item><tt>mkfontdir</tt>
</itemize>

<p>
There you go. You will now have all of your TrueType fonts working. If 
you want to add fonts, just move/copy those [*.ttf files] into the 
aforementioned directory, and repeat the process. 

Netscape has problems with these fonts, you have to check the "Allow
Scaling" setting in the Fonts dialog, don't feel distracted by the fact 
that it only shows font sizes 0 and 12. Mozilla has no such problems. 
Opera neither.

The <tt>mkfontdir</tt> executable should be included with your 
XFree 4.0.x distribution.

If you are missing <tt>ttmkfdir</tt>, you can obtain it here:

The latest verion of XFree86 (currently 4.0.2) can be found at:
