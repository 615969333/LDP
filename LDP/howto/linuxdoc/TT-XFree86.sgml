<sect1>Credits
<p>
I'd like to thank Bear Giles for his Debian TTF howto which brought
me on the right path :o).

Of course, credit should also go to the XFree86 crew for the enormous 
effort of maintaining XFree86, and Joerg Pommnitz for writing <tt>ttmkfdir</tt>.

Also I'd like to pass a BIG big thank you to the LDP for building and
maintaining a network of helping hands which already guided many
people through the hard to overcome the learning curve Linux has.

Thanks to Joe Meadows for notifying me that this howto probably described 
an illegal act in version 0.0.2 and earlier.

<sect>Procedure
<p>
Get a set of TrueType fonts (for example from one of the many sites
making fonts availiable for download) and do the following as 
root at the command line:

<itemize>
<item><tt>mkdir /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Truetype</tt>
<item><tt>cp /home/joeuser/yourdownloaddirectory/*.ttf /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Truetype</tt>
<item><tt>cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Truetype</tt>
<item><tt>ttmkfdir &gt; fonts.scale</tt>
<item><tt>mkfontdir</tt>
</itemize>

<p>
Now if you have a working installation of Windows on one of your partitions, 
you must use the fonts directly from there, copying them to a directory of 
your Linux partition is considered *illegal*. First read up on how to get 
your windows partition detected and working in Linux (most distributions do
that at installation time, and by default), then as root do the following:

<itemize>
<item><tt>cd /etc/X11</tt>

<item><tt>your-favourite-editor XF86Config</tt> In some X
distributions this file is used with a number added to it (for
example: <tt>XF86Config.4</tt>). You will have to find out which file
your X11R6 uses. You can do this by typing: <tt>less /var/log/XFree86*</tt>
and then instead edit the file stated in the log.

<item>Now, in the editor find the section <tt>Files</tt> and the lines
with <tt>FontPath</tt>, just add 
<tt>FontPath &quot;/yourwinpartition/windows/fonts/&quot;</tt>
at the bottom of this list.
(<tt>yourwinpartition</tt> must be replaced with the mount point of
your windows partition)

<item><tt>cd /winpartition/windows/fonts</tt>
<item><tt>ttmkfdir &gt; fonts.scale</tt>
<item><tt>mkfontdir</tt>
</itemize>

This will make all the fonts on your Windows partition work correctly in X.

<p>
There you go. You will now have all of your TrueType fonts working. If 
you want to add fonts, just move/copy those [*.ttf files] into the 
aforementioned directory, and repeat the process. 

Netscape has problems with these fonts, you have to check the "Allow
Scaling" setting in the Fonts dialog, don't feel distracted by the fact 
that it only shows font sizes 0 and 12. Mozilla has no such problems. 
Opera neither.

The <tt>mkfontdir</tt> executable should be included with your 
XFree 4.0.x distribution.

If you are missing <tt>ttmkfdir</tt>, you can obtain it here:
