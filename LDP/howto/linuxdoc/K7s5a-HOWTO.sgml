<abstract>
How to use Elite's K7s5a mainboard under GNU/Linux.
</abstract>
<sect>Introduction
<p>

I got the mainboard for Christmas 2001, and after a little while, I understood
 that the new chipset sis735 was not handled by <url
 url="http://www.mandrake.com" name="Mandrake"> 8.0,
<url url="http://www.opensound.com" name="OSS"> had drivers for it that worked
 but I didn't really want to pay for it, so  I looked on ALSA cvs and found that
 in their latest sources they had something for the sis 7012, and a bit later I found the drivers for the sensors.


<sect>The integrated sound board
<p>
<sect1>ALSA versus the AC'97 Driver
<p>
I have used both solutions successfully. However I noticed while working on a speech synthesis system (I'm involved into a small accessibility project), that the kernel driver do not seem to be able to re-sample, Alsa does it perfectly.
If something doesn't work, keep that in mind.

<sect1>Alsa
<sect2>Getting the ALSA drivers
<p>
So we'll compiling the latest sources from ALSA, which should work for any other
 distributions as well... just the kernel sources will change because mandrake uses
 specific patches.

You may get your kernel sources from your distribution or from <url
 url="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/" name="http://www.kernel.org">

Here can be found Mandrake sources for the kernel used in 8.0:

<url
 url="ftp://ftp.univ-savoie.fr/pub/Linux/Mandrake/8.0/i586/Mandrake/RPMS/kernel-
source-2.4.3-20mdk.i586.rpm"
 name="ftp://ftp.univ-savoie.fr/pub/Linux/Mandrake/8.0/i586/Mandrake/RPMS/kernel
-source-2.4.3-20mdk.i586.rpm">

(link seems to be broken, I wish I had made a copy if someone needed but here is the problem with that distribution, mirrors are not kept long enough)

and grab the tarball from ALSA:

<url url="ftp://ftp.alsa-project.org/pub/driver/alsa-driver-0.9.0beta10.tar.bz2"
 name="ftp://ftp.alsa-project.org/pub/driver/alsa-driver-0.9.0beta10.tar.bz2">

<sect2>Installing them
<p>
Install your kernel sources, in my case:

<em>rpm -ivh kernel-source-2.4.3-20mdk.i586.rpm</em>

Then decompress alsa drivers:

<em>bzip2 -d alsa-driver-0.9.0beta10.tar.bz2 && tar -xvf
 alsa-driver-0.9.0beta10.tar</em>

Make them and install them and create the devices files:

<em>cd alsa-driver-0.9.0beta10 && make install && ./snddevices</em>

Edit <tt>/etc/modules.conf</tt> to set everything, and add to it the following
 lines:

<tscreen><verb>
alias char-major-116 snd
alias char-major-14 soundcore
alias sound-slot-0 snd-card-0
alias sound-service-0-0 snd-mixer-oss
alias sound-service-0-1 snd-seq-oss
alias sound-service-0-3 snd-pcm-oss
alias sound-service-0-8 snd-seq-oss
alias sound-service-0-12 snd-pcm-oss
alias snd-card-0 snd-card-intel8x0
</verb></tscreen>
warning: Christian Cardinale nospam-christian.cardinale@libertysurf.fr reports thard he had to switch snd-card-intel8x0 to snd-intel8x0, which corresponds to what I have for my Debian system, I no longer remember, but I think it was that other name on the mandrake I used when first writing this howto, if it doesn't work, just switch to the other, ok?

<sect1>Alsa the Debian way
<p>I've switched to Debian some time after writing this howto and wanted to give some instructions about it:
Things may change a little depending on which version you're using, I use Debian sarge, currently the testing version.

<sect2>Using a Debian package with a precompiled kernel
<p>
First of all, you can directly download the appropriate precompiled alsa modules:
find out which kernel you're using

<em>uname -r</em>

2.4.20-3-k7	(should be 2.4.18-k7 or something like that for a woody/stable)

<em>apt-get install alsa-modules-2.4.20-3-k7</em>

the card is the "intel8x0 (PCI: Intel i810/i820/i830/i840/MX440 integrated audio)"

you should also install the recommended package alsa-utils

<em>apt-get install alsa-utils</em>

now, check the file /etc/alsa/modutils/0.9 against the one given further on this howto.
It may also be necessary to run update-modules as root to ensure that these lines get into /etc/modules.conf, although the package installation probably does it itself.

<sect2>Using a Debian kernel source package
<p>
I was forced to recompile my kernel when I got an usb adsl modem. (make-kpkg binary --initrd is something you want to look at someday, but it's off topic)

I'm assuming, you've done at least the following steps:

install the alsa sources and two useful packages:
<em>apt-get install alsa-source alsa-utils alsa-base</em>
debconf will ask you the following questions:

<tscreen><verb>Say Yes if you want to build ALSA driver with ISA PnP version. If your computer doesn't support ISA PnP, you may say No. 
Build ALSA driver with ISA PnP?</verb></tscreen>

You can safely select 'no'

<tscreen><verb>Say Yes if you want to build ALSA driver with debugging code.
Build ALSA driver with debugging code?</verb></tscreen>

We don't need that either, so select 'no'


<tscreen><verb>You can choose cards to be built by selecting cards you want. Each selection is a same name to a option of configure script '--with-cards'. The following list are short descriptions of the options to show what they mean.
Select cards to be built.</verb></tscreen>

Select card intel8x0 (PCI: Intel i810/i820/i830/i840/MX440 integrated audio)
and exit.

<em>cd /usr/src</em>

<em>tar xzvf alsa-driver.tar.gz</em>

<em>cd modules/alsa-driver</em>

<em>./configure</em>

<em>make && make install</em>

now, check the file /etc/alsa/modutils/0.9 against this following one.

<sect2>/etc/alsa/modutils/0.9
<p>
I only remember changing the cards_limit from 4 to 1, to prevent warnings, that's all, any modification of it, should be followed by update-modules in order to update /etc/modules.conf

<tscreen><verb>
### DEBCONF MAGIC
# This file was automatically generated by alsa-base's debconf stuff

alias char-major-116 snd
alias char-major-14 soundcore
alias snd-card-0 snd-intel8x0
alias sound-slot-0 snd-card-0 
options snd major=116 cards_limit=1 device_mode=0660 device_gid=29 device_uid=0

alias sound-service-0-0 snd-mixer-oss
alias sound-service-0-1 snd-seq-oss
alias sound-service-0-3 snd-pcm-oss
alias sound-service-0-8 snd-seq-oss
alias sound-service-0-12 snd-pcm-oss
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Kernel Approach: The AC'97 Driver
<p>
If you are using a 2.4 or later kernel you can use the <url
 url="http://developer.intel.com/ial/scalableplatforms/audio/" name="Audio Codec
 '97 (AC'97)"> sound driver, as the integrated sound card is AC'97 complaint.

You may enable your soundcard with a kernel module, as a matter of fact,
you should be able to just use the module without even recompiling
your kernel, because most GNU/Linux distributions have it already,
just type:

<em>modprobe i810_audio</em>

and you should see something like this in your syslog:

<tscreen><verb>
  Intel 810 + AC97 Audio, version 0.21, 21:31:04 Apr 15 2002
  i810: SiS 7012 found at IO 0xd800 and 0xdc00, IRQ 11
  i810_audio: Audio Controller supports 2 channels.
  ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, id: 0x414c:0x4710 (ALC200/200P)
  i810_audio: AC'97 codec 0 supports AMAP, total channels = 2
</verb></tscreen>

or type

<em>dmesg | less</em> and scroll to see the kernel messages.

If everything went fine, you may add <tt>i810_audio</tt> to
 <tt>/etc/modules</tt> so it will autoload everytime you boot:

<em>echo "i810_audio" >> /etc/modules</em>

<p>or you like monolitic kernels (no modules), follow the step above to install
 the kernel sources
and say Y to <tt>Sound card support</tt> and Y to <tt>Intel ICH (i8xx) audio
 support</tt>
compile your kernel, install, reboot and now your integrated soundcard is
 working.

If you don't know how to compile a kernel, read the <url
 url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html" name="Kernel HOWTO">,
it's easy and you'll get a optimized kernel for you system, also you'll learn a
 bit about that talk of using the source code (yes you are already taking
 advantage of it :-)

<sect>The mainboard's sensors
<p>
<sect1>lm-sensors
<sect2>Getting the drivers
<p>
Get the lm_sensors 2.6.2 or more recent:
<url url="http://www.lm-sensors.nu/archive/lm_sensors-2.6.2.tar.gz"
 name="http://www.lm-sensors.nu/archive/lm_sensors-2.6.2.tar.gz">
You'll need kernel sources too in order to compile that one.
<sect2>Installing them
<p>
<em>tar -xzvf i2c-2.6.2.tar.gz</em>

<em>cd i2c-2.6.2</em>

<em>make && make install</em>

Then there was a problem when making install for me, so if it doesn't work, just
 do the following:

<em>cp kernel/i2c-core.o /lib/modules/`uname -r`/misc/i2c-core.o</em>

<em>cp kernel/i2c-proc.o /lib/modules/`uname -r`/misc/i2c-proc.o</em>

Now let's copy the specific driver:

<em>cp kernel/chips/it87.o /lib/modules/`uname -r`/misc/it87.o</em>

ok now

<em>cp prog/sensors/sensors /usr/bin/sensors</em>

--------------------------------------------------------------------


Edit <tt>/etc/modules.conf</tt> and add to it the following lines:


<tscreen><verb>
alias char-major-89 i2c-dev
options it87 temp_type=0x31
</verb></tscreen>


now:

<em>modprobe i2c-proc</em>

<em>modprobe it87</em>

<em>modprobe i2c-isa</em>

<em>sensors</em>

should output you some data

When it works, you can write it to a file, that will be loaded automatically on
 boot. Under <url url="http://www.SuSE.de" name="SuSE"> the file is:
 <tt>/etc/init.d/boot.local</tt> (used to be <tt>/sbin/init.d/</tt>)
and you should just add: <tt>sensors -s</tt>
Under mandrake, the install should have created that file:
 <tt>/etc/init.d/sensors</tt>, which you can edit freely, sensord being just a
 daemon to watch over temperature and fan speed, I assume no one
will need something like that for her/his own machine.

Paolo reports that in order to start up sensord on boot, he put in /etc/sysconfig/sensors:
<tscreen><verb>
MODULE_0=i2c-proc
MODULE_1=it87
MODULE_2=i2c-isa
</verb></tscreen>


Now as root you should edit your <tt>/etc/sensors.conf</tt>
search for that line: <tt>chip "it87-*"</tt>
and below you should be able to modify everything to get the right data, here is
 a copy of what i have in there:
(please note that temp1 is trash and only temp2 and temp3 should be kept)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
<sect1>lm-sensors the Debian way
<p>
This time you'll be forced to compile the modules.
install the source and programs:

<em>apt-get install lm-sensors lm-sensors-source</em>

<tscreen><verb> The upstream lm-sensors maintainers know of a problem using 
 lm-sensors with IBM ThinkPad computers, resulting in 
 firmware corruption.  If you are installing this package on 
 a ThinkPad, you should wait until the upstream maintainers 
 have solved this problem before building modules from it.
 For more information, see 
 /usr/share/doc/lm-sensors-source/README.thinkpad.
 IBM ThinkPad brokenness -- really install lm-sensors?</verb></tscreen>
Answer yes to this question, you can't have an IBM thinkpad and the k7s5a in the same box as far as I know!

<em>cd /usr/src</em>

<em>tar xzvf lm-sensors.tar.gz</em>

<em>cd modules/lm-sensors/</em>

<em>make && make install</em>

Then you should have modutils take a few arguments,
the best way is probably to use a new file, like:
/etc/modutils/sensors
with this content:

<tscreen><verb>alias char-major-89 i2c-dev
options it87 temp_type=0x31</verb></tscreen>
run

<em>update-modules</em>

<em>modprobe i2c-isa it87</em>

You can now type sensors to access to the informations (note that you should edit sensors.conf, otherwise you'll see strange and inaccurate things :] )

You can also put i2c-isa and it87 in /etc/modules (one by line!) to have them be automatically loaded on boot, I don't know yet, how/whether it is possible to use some automatic loading/removing process with /etc/modules.conf

<sect1>Sensors.conf for the K7s5a

<sect>The mainboard's LAN adapter
<sect1>Making it work...

<p>If your board came with the optional on-board LAN card, you have a Silicon
 Integrated Systems [SiS] SiS900 10/100 Fast Ethernet card, this card is
 supported by Linux kernels 2.4 and later (that I know of, as I only use 2.4
 kernels).

<p>To make it work you should type

<em>modprobe sis900</em>

and you should see something like this in your syslog:

<tscreen><verb>
  sis900.c: v1.08.02 11/30/2001
  eth0: SiS 900 PCI Fast Ethernet at 0xd400, IRQ 5, 00:d0:09:ea:7a:98.
</verb></tscreen>

or type

<em>dmesg | less</em> and scroll to see the kernel messages.

If everything went fine, you may add <tt>sis900.o</tt> to <tt>/etc/modules</tt>
 so it will autoload everytime you boot:

<em>echo "sis900" >> /etc/modules</em>

(or <em>echo "alias eth0 sis900" >> /etc/modutils/aliases && update-modules</em> for the module to be loaded when needed, go for that if you have a Debian system)

Pay attention to the double >, or you will have troubles :]

or compile it in your kernel, where you should say Y to <tt>SiS 900/7016 PCI
 Fast Ethernet Adapter support</tt> in your kernel
configuration.


<sect>Other
<sect1>Knoppix
<p>
Yesterday (8/28/2003), I tried to boot with a Knoppix cd (3.2) and found out that the computer froze during the SCSI probes.

Here is a quick way to prevent this:

When you get the knoppix prompt, add noscsi and your lang settings and press enter:

<tscreen><verb>boot: knoppix noscsi lang=fr</verb></tscreen>

lang=fr is only to ensure that your language will be used even though we're overridding the append line.


<sect1>Notes about parallel port networking (PLIP) and floppy bus
<p>

I recently found out several important hardware flaws on this mainboard.
For example I could not get PLIP to work properly, if anyone has, let me know!
I used a grey laplink parallel cable (also known as Null Printer Cable)  a friend sold me and followed the <url url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/PLIP.html" name="PLIP Howto">. I could watch activity on the pins using a dos tool, but nothing went through, it even gave a warning:

<em>modprobe plip</em>

<em>tail /var/log/messages</em>

<tscreen><verb>kernel: plip: parport0 has no IRQ. Using IRQ-less mode,which is fairly inefficient!
kernel: NET3 PLIP version 2.4-parport gniibe@mri.co.jp
kernel: plip0: Parallel port at 0x378, not using IRQ.</verb></tscreen>

So I had to go on with floppies, since the box didn't have a cdrom drive, and there, I found out that the 486 had a much faster writing speed, more than 10 seconds of difference writing exactly the same image to the the same floppy...

<sect1>Some words

<p>Using a modified BIOS, I was able to successfully overclock my Athlon 1000Mhz
 to 1050Mhz flawlessy, but
when I messed with hdparm (30Gig Western Digital hard drive) using <em>hdparm
 -c1 -X66 /dev/hda</em>, I managed to corrupt my filesystem, so beware.

<p>If you are a real tweaker, you might want to change your BIOS Logo and stuff,
 some people tried that and it worked OK, some others
not, so they had to flash their BIOS again (blindly with a bootdisk and a
 working bios in it) to make the board work again. It is really up
to you. Search Google or OC Workbench and you'll be on your way.

<p>Good Luck! :-)

<sect>Contributions

<p>I was pretty surprised by the number of mails I received about this howto. Unfortunately I lost several contributions when my hard drive died but I'm always listening, so don't hesitate to mail us.
