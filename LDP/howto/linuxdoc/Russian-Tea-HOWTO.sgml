Caffeine is essential for keeping the brain active during nightly
 hacking  sessions. There are, however, many ways to satisfy a hacker's
 need for caffeine.  Drinking Canned Capitalism (Coke) contradicts
 the very principles of the open  source movement, for it is a closed
 source product, manufactured by a huge,  evil corporation. This sweet
 brown fizzy water is unhealthy and does not leave  any space for
 creativity; you just get what you pay for. It is like M&dollar; 
 Windoze. Coffee is somewhat better (much better, in fact), though
 it can cause  irreversible neural damage especially in young hackers
 still in larval stage  (e.g. K-8), if consumed in large quantities.
 Moreover, it is strongly addictive  and does not taste very good
 for those not yet addicted. A good tea, however,  induces catharctic
 sensations even in those, who drink it for the very first  time,
 warming one's mind, body, and soul. Many cultures have developed
 excellent  ways of producing delicious tea. The English, the Chinese,
 the Japanese and  many more have mastered the art of this divine
 beverage. In this HOWTO, however,  I would like to focus on my native,
 Russian way of preparing, serving and consuming  tea. The issues
 of scalability (preparing tea for yourself versus the LUG gathering),
 portability (preparing tea using different utensils), and quality
 control are  also addressed in this HOWTO. Cultural references are
 given for the curious.  Enjoy!

<sect>
The Basics 
<sect1>
What is tea 
<p>
First rule: tea is made of tea. Period. Other hot beverages based
 on leaves of vegetation different from the Tea Bush (<em>Thea sinensis</em>)
 are not tea. However, hot water and tea leaves do not necessary make
 good tea. The ways of wasting the precious leaves are amazingly plentiful
 and widespread. In America, for instance, making bad tea seems to
 be a matter of patriotism since the infamous incident in Boston.
 
</p> 

<p> Second rule: forget those paperbags. They are filled with the dust
 swept from the floor at tea factories. The bags give the tea an
 unmistakable flavor of cellulose. In Russia, we call it &quot;the postman's
 tea&quot;, because it comes in envelopes.  </p> <p> Third rule: never cook
 the tea leaves. The first contact of the tea leaves with water should
 happen right after the boiling of the latter. Neither before, nor long
 after. If you cook the tea leaves, you will obtain a liquid almost, but not
 entirely, unlike tea, fit for leather tanning, rather than drinking.
 
</p>

<sect1>
What makes it Russian 
<p>
If you adhere to the above rules, you make tea. Not necessarily
 good tea, but real tea, nevertheless. These rules are universal,
 there's nothing Russian so far. What makes all the difference, is
 the so-called &quot;<bf>zavarka</bf>&quot;, the tea concentrate. The Russian
 process of tea-making is a two stage one; First, you make the zavarka,
 then water it down with hot, boiled water (&quot;<bf>kipyatok</bf>&quot; in
 Russian). 
</p>
<p>
At this point, it is worth noting that it's the process sketched
 in section <ref id="osnovy" name="How to make it" >
 that makes the tea Russian. The origin of the tea leaves
 does not matter, whether they are from Georgia (a member state of
 the former Soviet Union, located in the Caucasus range on the shore
 of the Black Sea; home to the largest tea plantations in the Russian
 Empire and the S. U.) or from Ceylon (Sri Lanka, a former British
 colony, an island south of India). Nor do the utensils involved in
 the process of making or consumption. If hot water is poured onto
 tea bags from a <bf>samovar </bf>the result is still &quot;postman's tea&quot;
 which has little to do with Mother Russia. In my experience, fake
 Russian tea parties like this gained some popularity in certain circles.
 Don't let them fool you. Zavarka is what matters. It's that simple.
 
</p>
<sect1>
How to make it<label id="osnovy" >

<p>
Prior to any further action, you should boil a fair amount of
 water. You will need kipyatok at various stages of the process, and
 you will inevitably spill some of it during your first attempt. Actually,
 the more you fear spilling a liquid, the more likely it is that you
 will, because you are too cautious. Don't hesitate -- be resolute,
 but pay attention, as hot water is dangerous and carelessness may
 result in serious injuries. 
</p>
<p>
Boiled water is the only water used in the process of tea making.
 The Russian language actually makes a clear distinction between &quot;boiled
 water&quot; and &quot;raw water&quot;. The latter is often misinterpreted
 by non-native speakers as wet water (as opposed to dry water?), which
 is funny. Although these substances are very similar, they behave
 very differently under certain circumstances for some mysterious
 reason. Even a minute quantity of raw water, no matter how hot, can
 spoil the tea. Therefore, keep the water boiling for a while in order
 to make sure that it is boiled thoroughly.  
</p>
<p>
The basic steps of zavarka preparation are as follows: 
</p>
<p>
<enum>
 <item>
Put a certain amount of tea leaves into some pot, 
 <item>
Pour kipyatok onto them (approx. one cup for each five teaspoons)
 in one resolute spurt, 
 <item>
Wait until all the leaves sink. 
</enum>
<p>
<descrip>
 <tag>
WARNING:</tag>Never drink the zavarka undiluted. It has a strong
 narcotic effect, causing intense heartbeat, hallucinations and restlessness.
 This effect has been widely used by captives in Russian prisons and
 forced labor camps, since tea has always been included into the rations
 of the prisoners. The name of tea-based narcotics in the Russian
 criminal slang is &quot;<bf>chephyr</bf>&quot;. If you introduce Russian tea-drinking
 into some non-Russian company, don't forget to label the zavarka
 pot! Otherwise, ignorant people might drink its content, and die
 of a heart attack as a consequence. You, in turn, may face lawsuits
 or vendetta depending on the culture you live in. 
</descrip>
</p><p>
Now, you are ready to make your first cup of Russian tea. Pour
 some zavarka into a teacup and dilute it with kipyatok. The ratio
 is approximately 10:1, though it may change as your deadlines approach.
 Actually, the strength of the tea depends both on this ratio and
 the strength of the zavarka. Given the brand, the strength can be
 inferred from the color. 
</p>
<p>
The color of the tea should be similar to that of a chestnut.
 If your glass, cup, or mug has vertical walls (constant horizontal
 cross-section, that is), you can control the color very easily. Observe
 that the color of the tea does not change if you look from above,
 assuming the water is completely transparent (the proof of this statement
 is left as an exercise to the reader). Therefore, all you have to
 do is pour zavarka until it reaches the desired color, and water
 it down thereafter. Cups with increasing horizontal cross-sections
 do not offer such an easy method, you will either have to solve an
 integral equation or make an educated guess. 
</p>
<p>
Lastly, I would like to draw your attention to a very important
 detail. Many of the steps in the Russian method of tea preparation
 are time consuming and might appear superfluous at first glance.
 Good tea, however, takes patience and commitment; all shortcuts degrade
 the final product. Don't hurry, take your time. As the wise Russian
 proverb goes: &quot;If you rush, you just make people laugh.&quot;
 
</p>
<sect>
Choice of ingredients 
<sect1>
The water 
<p>
Water matters big time. As unbelievable as it may sound, the
 quality of the water and the way we treat it determine the quality
 of the product to an equal, if not greater, extent than the tea leaves.
 The best tea can be spoiled by poor quality water, while careful
 treatment and the right choice of water along with the right technology
 can work wonders even with the cheapest tea. 
</p>
<p>
First, I would like to repeat: all the water involved should
 be thoroughly boiled and hot. Never ever use raw water that hasn't
 been boiled, no matter how hot it is. Boiled water that has somewhat
 cooled down is equally unacceptable for most purposes, though at
 the final stage (watering down the zavarka) it is less harmful than
 raw water. 
</p>
<p>
The source of the water also deserves some attention. Most of
 the time, hackers are compelled to use the water from the hot water
 faucet. As tempting as it may be, using this water is disadvantageous.
 Hot water spends more time in pipes, and being more active in chemical
 reactions, carries more pollution than cold water. Therefore, you'd
 better stick to the cold water. Furthermore, after opening the faucet,
 let the water flow until it reaches its final cool temperature before
 collecting it for tea. Residual water usually tastes worse than fresh
 water. 
</p>
<p>
Although natural sources, such as springs, unpolluted lakes,
 fresh snow in the countryside, and so on are great in general, some
 comments are to be made. High concentration of calcium or potassium
 ions harms the boiling equipment and somewhat degrades the taste
 of the tea. Therefore, if possible, avoid artesian water in areas
 where the soil is rich in limestone. The softer the water is, the
 better tea it makes. 
</p>
<p>
Interestingly enough, the actual <it>taste</it> of the cold water does
 not matter as much as one would expect. This does not mean of course,
 that you can use water with some repulsive odor or taste, but if
 some water appears to be extremely delicious, don't rush to make
 tea out of it; you're better off drinking it raw. 
</p>
<sect1>
The leaves 
<p>
Of course, there are good tea brands and poor ones, but again,
 the right technology and careful treatment work wonders. Although
 in other fields of life the package might be less important than
 the internals, with tea it is almost exactly the opposite. Since
 the flavor of the tea is due to volatiles, the package should be
 firmly sealed and airtight. Personally, I prefer cube-shaped metallic
 boxen with round hatches, which one can open using the handle of
 a teaspoon as a lever. They can be reused to hold tea from cheaper
 packages, like plastic or impregnated paper bags, which cannot be
 properly resealed. 
</p>
<p>
If you take a look at the unit prices of tea, you may notice
 that the distribution is essentially bimodal. There is a clear distinction
 between cheap and expensive tea. Expensive, selected tea usually
 has a strong aroma, characteristic to the particular brand, which
 you may or may not like. Generic cheap tea, in contrast, is usually
 acceptable to everyone. However, mixing expensive and inexpensive
 tea is not only acceptable, but strongly recommended and encouraged.
 Moreover, you can mix different tea and amaze your guests with the
 unique flavor invented by yourself. Since the Russian technology
 of tea preparation preserves the aroma very well, it is usually recommended
 to dissolve expensive, flavored tea in some good, generic tea (that
 is, to mix the leaves <it>before</it> making zavarka). 
</p>
<p>
There are, however, poor quality leaves, which are best avoided.
 Firstly, tea in less airtight packaging that hasn't been sold for
 a long time loses its aroma. If you buy tea in paperbags or cardboard
 boxes, pay attention to the date of production. Even if you choose
 to buy it, pour it immediately into some airtight, resealable package
 (e.g. a metallic box). The second important factor is the granularity.
 Finely grained, dust-like tea is a by-product of tea production.
 Selling it as tea is a consequence of the typical capitalist rush
 for efficiency that sacrifices quality on the altar of productivity.
 Don't buy dust swept off the floor. The other extreme is the rough
 tea possibly containing parts of the tea plant other than the leaves.
 This is due to the careless treatment characteristic of planned economies.
 Underpaid slaves or irresponsible workers who get paid no matter
 how badly they work are prone to such crimes. 
</p>
<p>
Anyhow, I challenge you to experiment with various tea brands;
 mix them at will. Share your experience with others. And don't hesitate
 to ask your host what leaves s/he uses if you happen to be offered
 some tea you like. In my experience, even a hint of selected, flavored
 tea can ameliorate generic inexpensive tea to an amazing degree.
 Remember: you can't spoil tea with tea. 
</p>
<sect1>
Additions 
<p>
Tea is a full-featured beverage on its own right. Some claim
 that any addition will only make it worse by suppressing its genuine
 taste. Despite such opinions, many drink tea with different additions
 making it sweeter, sourer or inebriative. I would like to give a
 brief overview, so that you can decide what to do. 
</p>
<sect2>
Sweeteners 
<p>
Sweetening of the tea is very popular. It has to be noted, though,
 that this practice is unhealthy for your teeth. After hacking all
 night long sipping on your sweet tea, wash your teeth thoroughly
 before going into bed. 
</p>
<p>
<descrip>
 <tag>
Sugar:</tag>Sugar is the cheapest and the most widespread way
 to make your tea sugared. Sugared tea usually contributes to clear
 thinking more than the unsugared kind. But of course, if you prefer
 to fuel your braincells without disturbing the original flavor of
 the tea, you can eat jelly or candies instead of adding sugar to
 the tea. More than three teaspoons of sugar can ruin the beverage:
 it becomes a syrup. Exercise self-control. 
 <tag>
Glucose:</tag>A less trivial way to sugar your tea. Essentially
 the same as sugar, except that it tastes better and feeds braincells
 more efficiently than ordinary sugar. The true hacker's choice. Especially
 recommended before exams or approaching deadlines. 
 <tag>
Honey:</tag>Very healthy and very Russian. Caught the flu? No
 problem. Three spoons of honey and a resolute spurt of vodka into
 your tea, and off to bed you go. Of course, you do not need to be
 sick to drink tea with honey. 
 <tag>
Fruit 
jam:</tag>Some Russians prefer to put fruit jam into the
 tea. Others eat it separately. Changes the taste of the tea dramatically,
 though not necessarily in an unpleasing fashion. 
 <tag>
Saccharine 
and 
other 
artificial 
sweeteners:</tag>The taste of
 sugar, without the benefits and disadvantages thereof. Unless you
 have diabetes but cannot drink unsweetened tea, there is no point
 in contaminating your tea with such chemicals. Real hackers prefer
 the real thing to substitutes. 
</descrip>
</p><sect2>
Alcohol 
<p>
Alcoholic influence degrades the quality of your code. Therefore,
 you should abstain from alcohol while hacking. And while driving.
 If, however, you are celebrating a finished project or a successful
 exam or whatever, a touch of alcohol can't hurt. 
</p>
<p>
Tea with alcohol loosens inhibitions and relaxes the muscles
 of the mouth. Thus, it is very helpful for learning foreign languages.
 Learn Russian! It's a fun language, not to mention the abundance
 of dirt-cheap scientific and technical literature available in it,
 both on- and off-line. 
</p>
<p>
In this section we will take a look at the ways of cheering up
 your tea. 
</p>
<p>
<descrip>
 <tag>
Vodka:</tag>Since the outstanding Russian chemist, Dmitrij Ivanovich
 Mendeleyev (same guy who devised the periodic table of elements)
 invented and standardized the technology of 40&percnt; vol/vol vodka
 production, you have Absolut control over the alcohol content of
 your tea. If the ratio of vodka does not exceed one third, we speak
 of tea with vodka. If it is between one and two thirds, we speak
 of a sailor's tea. Beyond that, it is contaminated (or pure) vodka.
 But come on, hackers claim to be intellectuals, right? You will need
 your braincells in the future. 
 <tag>
Rum:</tag>This is the Caribbean variant of vodka, distilled
 from sugar cane. Its special flavor fits very well to that of the
 tea. Make a stand against imperialism, support the Isle of Freedom!
 Did you know that the Castro regime runs its website on a Linux box
 and funds the local LUG? ;-) 
 <tag>
Liquor:</tag>Very ladylike. 
</descrip>
</p><sect2>
Other stuff 
<p>
<descrip>
 <tag>
Lemon:</tag>Some like it, some do not. Find out for yourself
 which category you belong to. Note, that even a drop of lemon juice
 makes the color of the tea substantially lighter. This is because
 tea has properties similar to litmus: in an acidic environment it
 lightens, while in an alkalic environment it darkens. Hence, you
 can find out if you have rinsed the detergent off the cup insufficiently
 even before letting the soapy tea into your mouth (FYI: detergents
 are bases). Some claim that tea with lemon is healthy, because of
 its high C vitamin content. Bu^H^HNonsense. Molecules of ascorbic
 acid disintegrate at a temperature much lower than that of the tea.
 Whether or not to put lemon in your tea, should depend solely on
 your taste. 
 <tag>
Baking soda:</tag>This is a dirty trick, used primarily by state-operated,
 cheap catering enterprises in Russia. As you can infer from the description
 of the lemon, the alkalic nature of baking soda makes the tea substantially
 darker, even if added in very small quantities. Makes almost no difference
 in taste, but the tea will look much stronger than it is in reality. No
 self-respecting tea-drinker would cheat his/her guests (or oneself) by
 darkening the tea by any means other than more zavarka. This paragraph is
 intended to give you a clue in case the tea you have been offered looked
 great but tasted like hot rainwater. 
 <tag>
Milk:</tag>Adding milk to the tea is actually an English custom.
 Nevertheless, it's fine as long as you don't mind sweating like a
 pony. Smokers tend to like it for its detoxicating effect; tea with
 milk cancels the weariness caused by tobacco. 
 <tag>
Cream:</tag>Similar to milk, only less common. And less cost-effective.
 
 <tag>
WARNING:</tag>Lemon and milk/cream conflict. They are incompatible.

</descrip>
</p><sect>
Utensils and their usage 
<sect1>
The zavarka pot<label id="chajnik" >

<p>
Zavarka is usually prepared in a teapot (&quot;<bf>chainik</bf>&quot;
 in Russian) made of some sort of ceramic or glass. In either case,
 the inside has to be hot at the moment you put the leaves therein.
 Usually, this is achieved by steaming (on the inside), but rinsing
 with hot water does the job equally well. Russians disagree as to
 whether the pot should be wet or dry. The followers of the latter
 opinion wipe it dry with a cloth or a napkin after steaming. In my
 experience, it makes no difference. Hence, I stick to the minimum-effort
 approach and leave it wet. 
</p>
<p>
Once you put the leaves into the pot, close it, and let them
 warm up and release some of the volatiles. It is essential that you
 keep the pot closed at this time; otherwise, you risk losing aroma.
 After 5 to 10 seconds, you should pour hot, boiled water onto the
 leaves, and close the pot again. When all the leaves sink, the zavarka
 is ready. 
</p>
<p>
It is strongly recommended that you keep the chainik warm by
 covering it with a cloth, a knitted cap, or the skirt of a special
 doll (&quot;<bf>baba</bf>&quot;), which is the traditional Russian way. Warming
 the chainik with steam is allowed, but never boil the zavarka inside.
 Warming after it has cooled down is meaningless. Either keep it warm,
 or let it cool down. Once it has cooled, you best leave it that way.
 
</p>
<p>
The canonical chainik has a circular bottom and a circular top
 hatch. Moreover, these two circles are of identical diameter (8 centimeters),
 so that they fit into the crown of a standard (<tt>GOST 
7400-75</tt>) samovar.
 Cheap chainiks are available in the Chinese markets. 
</p>
<p>
If you have to make tea for a crowd -- say, at a LUG meeting
 -- regular chainiks can prove to be too small. In this case, bigger
 teapots of glass or metal can be utilized. 
</p>
<p>
In any case, you might want to filter out the tea leaves, since
 they are claimed to cause cancer (like everything else in this world)
 if swallowed directly. Russians use a special hemispheric metallic
 net for this purpose (&quot;<bf>sitechko</bf>&quot;), which is hung from the
 spout of the pot.  
</p>
<p>
In case of emergency -- say, if your chainik has broken into
 a thousand pieces -- zavarka can be brewed in an ordinary mug. This
 procedure, however, requires skill and care. First off, you'd have
 to find some way to cover the mug in order to preserve the aroma.
 Secondly, pouring the right amount of zavarka out of an ordinary
 mug without a spout is a task very far from trivial. You have been
 warned. 
</p>
<sect1>
The Samovar<label id="samovar" >
<sect2>
What a Samovar is, and what it is not 
<p>
Let us begin with the etymology and the morphology of the word.
 The Russian prefix &quot;samo-&quot; is somewhat similar to Latin
 &quot;auto-&quot; and English &quot;self-&quot;. The second part
 of words beginning with the &quot;samo-&quot; prefix usually derives
 from a verb. Thus, &quot;samolet&quot; (literally: flies by itself)
 means <em>aircraft</em>, &quot;samokat&quot; (literally: rolls by itself)
 means <em>roller</em>, and &quot;samogon&quot; (literally: self-distilled)
 means <em>illegal whiskey</em>. The &quot;-var&quot; part derives from a verb
 meaning both <em>brewing</em> and <em>cooking</em>. Therefore, the proper literal translation
 of &quot;samovar&quot; would be &quot;autobrewer&quot; -- a device
 that brews tea automagically. 
</p>
<p>
However, samovars are not fool-proof, self-reliant devices; they
 require care and attention, which they pay off with years and decades
 (if not centuries) of reliable and faithful service. Furthermore,
 we never brew anything <it>inside</it> the samovar, although it is true that
 the samovar might serve as the only source of energy in the entire
 process of tea-making. All steps of Russian tea-making with a samovar
 involve some operation with this truly wonderful machine. Therefore,
 its central role is unquestionable. 
</p>
<p>
In short, samovars are fit for the following tasks: 
</p>
<p>
<enum>
 <item>
water boiling 
 <item>
steaming 
 <item>
boiled water portioning 
</enum>
</p><p>
In a broad sense, all utensils capable of the above operations
 could be samovars, though in general, we call so only those consisting
 of a brass boiler with a faucet near its bottom, steam-holes and
 a teapot socket at its top, and some heating device inside. 
</p>
<p>
At this point, I would like to emphasize that the samovar is
 not just an ordinary item in the household, but also a hallmark of
 the Russian way of life and hospitality. 
</p>
<sect2>
Brief history of the Samovar 
<p>
When Americans were busy dumping tea into the dark waters of
 Boston harbor (late eighteenth century), a Russian gunsmith, Fedor
 Lisitsin, set up a small workshop south of Moscow, in the city of
 Tula, the heart of the Russian defense industry. Lisitsin and his
 two sons were laboring in their time free from making arms and ammunition
 for Mother Russia on a rather unusual device, which had been hitherto
 handcrafted by individual craftsmen in the Ural region solely for
 personal use: the <bf>charcoal-burning samovar</bf>. 
</p>
<p>
Lisitsin's workshop was the first to produce samovars industrially
 and had tremendous success. Due to the blessed lack of IP law enforcement
 in Russia, which endures to our days, competing samovar-factories
 sprang up in Tula like mushrooms after the rain. By the thirties
 of the nineteenth century, Tula established itself as the capital
 of Samovar-making. 
</p>
<p>
During the nineteenth century, samovars gained increasing popularity
 in major cities, such as St. Petersburg and Moscow, and became inseparably
 bound to the Russian way of life. Classics of Russian literature,
 like Pushkin, Gogol and Chekhov, regularly mention samovars in their
 works. Anton Pavlovich Chekhov has even coined an idiom, which stands
 for an utterly wasteful effort: <it>to take one's own samovar to Tula</it>.
 This phrase is still understood and occasionally used by most Russians
 (even on Linux-related mailing lists). You know, it's like writing
 a new C compiler for your project, instead of using GCC. 
</p>
<p>
In the second half of the nineteenth century, samovar manufacturing
 took root in Moscow, St. Petersburg and some industrialized parts
 of Siberia and the Ural region. However, Tula retained its leading
 and standard-setting role in this trade. By that time, four shapes
 of samovars became traditional: <bf>cylindric</bf>, <bf>egg-like</bf>, <bf>spherical</bf> and
 the most beautiful of them all, those resembling the ancient Greek
 vase called <bf>crater</bf>. 
</p>
<p>
The beginning of the twentieth century has been marked with various
 attempts at innovation. The traditional heating method has been challenged
 by gasoline, petroleum, kerosene, gas, and other means of heating
 at that time. However, these models proved unpopular, due to the
 repugnant odor of the fuels and the dangers of inflammation and explosion.
 
</p>
<p>
Railroad companies in Russia recognized the practicality and
 popularity of samovars and fitted long-distance sleeping cars with
 them. Luxurious cars of the Trans-Siberian railroad were first to
 adopt this custom. Today, all sleeping cars from second class up
 are equipped with a samovar at the end of the hallway, next to the
 conductor's closet. Just in case you need some hot water during your
 journey... 
</p>
<p>
During World War I and the subsequent turmoil of revolutions
 and civil war, the design and the production technology of samovars
 were largely simplified and made fit for the military. It was during
 that time that huge samovars holding dozens of liters of water became
 common. Roughly welded cylindric samovars devoid of decoration are
 characteristic of the period. 
</p>
<p>
The late twenties and early thirties saw Stalinist collectivization
 and industrialization. Small samovar-making workshops were integrated
 into vast factories or disbanded. Quantity took priority over quality.
 However, it was during this period that the largest samovar-manufacturer
 of the Soviet Union, the &quot;Shtamp&quot; company, was founded.
 In Tula, of course. 
</p>
<p>
During World War II, factories of the defense industry -- and
 samovars have always been byproducts of military production -- were
 moved from the European part of the Soviet Union to behind the Ural
 mountain range, out of the reach of fascist intruders. Thus, skillful
 samovar-manufacturers and essential equipment were saved, despite
 the Nazi occupation of Tula. 
</p>
<p>
The fifties and sixties brought significant changes. Ground-breaking
 technologies provided mankind with wondrous inventions: space travel,
 nuclear powerplants, supersonic jets, and the nickel-plated electric
 samovar. 
</p>
<p>
The hitherto undisputed reign of the charcoal-burning samovar
 came to an end. The gentle flavor of smoke proved to be insufficient
 in the face of such benefits as the ease of use and convenience,
 reduced tea-brewing time and the ease of cleaning, let alone the
 longevity provided by the nickel-plating that protects brass from
 corrosion. Catering facilities and households embraced the new technology
 swiftly; Only the railroads remained faithful to the smoky, charcoal-fueled,
 traditional samovar. 
</p>
<p>
The period of Brezhnevian stagnation did not leave any marks
 on the samovar. In fact, only the Olympic games of 1980, during which
 an incredible amount of samovars were sold to visitors from abroad
 affected the samovar: it gained international recognition and became
 a symbol of Russia. 
</p>
<p>
While the samovars on the railroads resisted electrification,
 the other prerequisite of communism postulated by V. I. Lenin, ceased
 to exist in the nineties: the soviet power. The second dawn of capitalism
 in Russia brought the samovar industry back to its original shape.
 Recent spin-offs of the Shtamp corporation are competing for their
 share of the samovar-market with newly founded businesses. 
</p>
<p>
A Tula company, no matter whether it produces radars, guns, refrigerators
 or armored vehicles, must have a samovar workshop. Thus, if you're
 seeking venture capital to start an ISP or a software development
 company in Tula, don't forget to mention samovar manufacturing in
 your business plan. 
</p>
<p>
What does the future of samovars look like? Will the twenty-first
 century bring internet-enabled computer-controlled samovars that
 guide us through the tea-brewing process in the language of our choice?
 Certainly not. Two engineering principles, often overlooked by western
 engineers, became second nature to their Russian colleagues due to
 the stormy history of Russia and the constant need for working, mission-critical
 technology in extreme or downright hostile environments. First, we
 keep things as simple as possible: &quot;the more complicated, the
 sooner dead&quot; as the proverb goes. Second, one must not fix what
 works. During the above outlined process of evolution, the samovar
 achieved technical perfection: nothing to add, nothing to take away.
 Like a good UNIX utility, it serves one purpose, and serves it well.
 
</p>
<sect2>
Samovar Anatomy I. -- The charcoal-burning samovar 
<p>
The parts of the samovar beginning from the bottom up are as
 follows: 
</p>
<p>
<enum>
 <item>
Nearly all samovars have a four-legged square-shaped foundation.
 This keeps the samovar from damaging the furniture with its heat.
 
 <item>
Above that, we find the &quot;neck&quot; of the samovar, or <bf>&quot;sheika&quot;
 </bf>in Russian. The neck thickens towards its top, where the ventilation
 chamber (the windbox) resides. This chamber has small intakes (holes)
 along its perimeter in order to supply the combustion process with
 oxygen from the atmosphere. The foundation with the neck together
 are referred to as &quot;<bf>poddon</bf>&quot;. 
 <item>
At this point the actual boiler begins. Inside, we find a thick
 tube (in Russian: &quot;<bf>truba</bf>&quot;) which constitutes the combustion
 chamber. The bottom of this tube is separated from the ventilation
 chamber with bars to prevent the fuel from falling therein. This
 separation we call &quot;<bf>kolosiak</bf>&quot; in Russian. 
 <item>
Near the bottom of the boiler, a small faucet (&quot;<bf>kran</bf>&quot;)
 protrudes from the tank. It consists of three parts: a small decoration
 at its stem (the &quot;<bf>repe'ek</bf>&quot;), that contributes to the rigidity
 of the mounting, the pipe itself, and an extremely simple valve with
 a handle (&quot;<bf>vetka</bf>&quot;). The valve is essentially a funnel with
 a hole. In the two extreme positions of the handle the valve is closed,
 while in central position the water can pour through the hole. It
 is the weight of the valve and the handle that keeps the whole thing
 in place; you can simply pull it out upwards. No O-rings, no gaskets,
 no bearings, no screws -- nothing to go wrong. 
 <item>
The hatch of the boiler has two small handles protecting your
 hands from the heat. These two handles are denoted by the same word
 that means pine-cones: &quot;<bf>shishki</bf>&quot;. There are also small
 steaming holes (&quot;<bf>dushinki</bf>&quot;) on the hatch. Their purpose
 is to prevent the samovar from explosion and to steam the teapot
 at the same time. 
 <item>
The whole construction is topped off by a crown-like teapot socket,
 often decorated with some ornament. This part of the samovar is called
 &quot;<bf>kamforka</bf>&quot;. 
 <item>
Finally, charcoal-burning samovars come with two accessories:
 a cap and a chimney extension for the tube. Both need to be placed
 onto the open end of the heating tube, though not at the same time.
 
</enum>
</p><sect2>
Samovar Anatomy II. -- The electric samovar 
<p>
Rather than enumerating all the parts of the electric samovar,
 we just highlight the differences from its smoke-puffing predecessor.
 
</p>
<p>
The first -- and most important -- difference is the look and
 the purpose of the thicker part of the neck: instead of ventholes,
 you'd find one big electric socket on its perimeter; In the place
 of the empty ventilation chamber of the charcoal-burner, the electric
 samovar has a packed electric compartment. 
</p>
<p>
The most apparent difference, however, is arguably the lack of
 the characteristic tube. A huge spiral of an electric immersion heater
 is what occupies the tube's place. 
</p>
<p>
Inside the ventilation chamber, which you can access by unscrewing
 the nut at the bottom of the samovar, you will find the connections
 of the heating coil. The coil itself is insulated from the spiral's
 body (and thus the samovar itself) by a set of ceramic rings. The
 coil with the white insulator rings resembles the backbone of some
 fish, if you pull it out of the heater. 
</p>
<p>
In order to unscrew the nut (with a metric M6 thread, in most
 cases) at the bottom, you will need a metric wrench (usually a 10mm
 one). The one used for your bike or your car would do. Do not apply
 your swiss army knife, though. The refined Swiss tool is just not
 appropriate for the rugged Russian machinery. 
</p>
<p>
The last important distinguishing feature of the electric samovar
 is the position of the steaming holes; The lack of the tube allows
 for a more convenient place right at the center of the kamforka.
 
</p>
<p>
Some samovars have a special floating device near the heater,
 which turns the latter off, if the water in the tank does not engulf
 the spiral entirely. This design, however, did not prove very popular,
 since it has an additional moving part, which, in turn, constitutes
 yet another point of failure. Thus, it caused more problems than
 it solved, so Russians chose to look after the simpler samovars.
 Generally, Russian technology assumes dumb machines and smart humans,
 not the other way around. 
</p>
<p>
Don't complain about the missing switch -- just pull the plug,
 if you want to turn the heating off; the only moving part in a samovar
 should be the valve of the faucet. 
</p>
<sect2>
How to Use the Samovar 
<p>
Charcoal-burning samovars are strictly outdoor equipment. Even
 today you can encounter them at rural garden-parties in remote, cozy
 <bf>dacha</bf>s, where laptop computers run on batteries and the only access
 to the Internet is a satellite link. 
</p>
<p>
The first thing to do with a samovar is to clean it thoroughly
 and fill it up with water through its open hatch. A samovar shining
 bright in the sunlight is a sign of hospitality and good manners
 of the party's host. 
</p>
<p>
Now, it is time to load the device with fuel. Instead of charcoal,
 Russians often use dry pine-cones. Cones add a hint of resin's flavor
 to the tea, which is especially precious to hardware hackers, the
 Knights of the Soldering Iron. 
</p>
<p>
No matter whether you use charcoal or pine-cones, you've got
 to ignite the fuel somehow. The traditional way is to use pieces
 of bark from a birch-tree. In the soviet era, we used Pravda, the
 newspaper of the Communist Party. Proprietary software licenses work
 just as well. 
</p>
<p>
As soon as the igniting substance and smaller pieces of the fuel
 catch fire, you need to pump on the upper end of the tube, in order
 to help the fire burn. The canonical pumping device is a Russian
 infantry boot. Finally, attach the chimney extension and wait until
 the water boils. 
</p>
<p>
Controlling the oxidation process is somewhat simpler than controlling
 a nuclear reactor, though the principles are similar. In order to
 abate the fire, put the cap on the tube instead of the chimney. If,
 however, you want to stimulate the heater, apply the pump. 
</p>
<p>
When the water boils, cover the tube with the cap, and steam
 the chainik with the steam coming from dushinki. Then prepare zavarka
 as described in sections <ref id="osnovy" name="How to make it" >
 and <ref id="chajnik" name="The zavarka pot" >
. 
</p>
<p>
Put the zavarka pot where it belongs: onto the top of the kamforka.
 It will keep it warm. 
</p>
<p>
You shall dilute the zavarka with kipyatok poured from the samovar.
 
</p>
<p>
Electric samovars can operate indoors. Their operation is much
 simpler, since the only thing you need to do to start one heating
 is to plug it into the AC outlet. To stop it, you, respectively,
 pull the plug out. Always make sure that the heater is fully immersed
 in water, when turned on. 
</p>
<sect2>
Samovars in North America 
<p>
In North America, charcoal-burning samovars can be used exactly
 the same way we use them in Russia, except, perhaps, that you should
 warn each participant of the garden-party, preferably in written
 form, about the dangers of scalding themselves. Otherwise, some ignorant
 bastard might sue your pants off, should s/he touch the samovar in
 the wrong place. 
</p>
<p>
The operation of Russian electric samovars is somewhat more involved,
 given the differences in the AC grid. First off, the frequency differs:
 as opposed to the Russian 50 Hz, North America operates at 60 CPS
 (unit conversion: 1 Hertz = 1 Cycle Per Second). This difference
 does not affect the samovars in any way. 
</p>
<p>
The difference in voltage is more salient. Recall Ohm's Law:
 <it>R=U/I</it> and the definition of electric power: <it>P=UI</it>. 
</p>
<p>
>From these two equations it is apparent that the heating power
 of the same resistance at half the voltage is one fourth of the original
 value. Assuming the samovar's heating coil linear and the losses
 negligible, it would take four times as long to boil the water in
 the same samovar in America than it took in Russia. Fortunately enough,
 non-linearities work to your advantage. 
</p>
<p>
The last obstacle is the difference in connectors. You can overcome
 it either by replacing the plug with an American one, or by utilizing
 a so called &quot;outlet adapter&quot; (Radio Shack part <tt>&num;273-1406D</tt>).
 Don't forget the grounding! 
</p>
<p>
The brave and impatient can hack up the samovar to operate just
 as fast as it does in Russia. In order to achieve the same power
 at half the voltage, you'll need one fourth of the resistance. Now,
 recall the definition of resistance in terms of dimensions: <it>R=rl/A</it>,
 whereby <it>l </it>denotes the length of the resistor, <it>A</it> its cross-section
 and <it>r </it>is a constant that depends on the properties of the material.
 The volume of this resistor would be <it>V=lA</it>. 
</p>
<p>
In order not to affect the longevity of the spiral, you'd better
 preserve the volume of the heating element, while decreasing its
 resistance. If you take a look at the two above formulae, you'd notice
 that halving the length and doubling the cross-section would achieve
 exactly the desired effect. So, pull the spiral out, remove the insulation,
 fold it in two, and stretch it to the desired length before putting
 the insulation back. If you cannot stretch the spiral without risking
 its integrity, you can prolong it with a thick copper-wire. 
</p>
<sect1>
Other waterboiling devices 
<p>
In this section we will review some gadgets that come handy when
 you need boiled water &quot;out there&quot;. That is, usually far
 from your home, on the move, etc. It does not cover the entire range
 of waterboiling devices available in the stores, since their usage
 is straightforward and well documented in the accompanying user's
 guide. Rather, I will focus on simple, practical devices popular
 among hackers and ordinary Russians (and ordinary Russian hackers)
 that can help one out under most unusual circumstances. 
</p>
<sect2>
The Whistling Tin Pot 
<p>
One of the most cost-effective ways of obtaining boiled water
 is to place a metallic boiling pot with a whistle onto the stove.
 It whistles when the water is boiling inside <it>and </it>if the hatch is
 closed. So, don't forget to close it. 
</p>
<p>
Always direct the spout toward the wall, in order to avoid injuries
 caused by the hot steam. Moreover, it is much more convenient that
 way. Some models are prone to shoot the whistle off after a few seconds
 of whistling. Be extremely cautious with those. 
</p>
<sect2>
The Primus 
<p>
This is a propane-buthan canister integrated with a stove. For
 outdoor use only. Great in winter; makes kipyatok out of thawed snow.
 Handle with care. 
</p>
<sect2>
The Immersion Heater 
<p>
The immersion heater (Russian term: &quot;<bf>kipyatil'nik</bf>&quot;)
 is one of the most frequent reasons for expelling hackers (esp. Russians,
 since many of them are notorious tea addicts) from dormitories for
 fire safety violations, second, perhaps, only to the soldering iron.
 
</p>
<p>
It is an extremely simple device that boils water when plugged
 into the AC outlet. You can make kipyatok practically in any fire-proof
 cavity (no plastic or impregnated paper cups!) that can sustain boiling
 water. Make sure that the immersion heater is totally immersed in
 the water when you turn it on, when you turn it off, and all the
 time in between. 
</p>
<p>
<descrip>
 <tag>
WARNING:</tag>Never leave an immersion heater unattended. As
 soon as the water boils, pull the plug. Even the unplugged heater
 is very hot for a relatively long period of time. Excercise caution
 when dealing with such a beast! And do not forget to hide it well
 in the meantime... 
</descrip>
</p><sect1>
The Saucer 
<p>
In a well-kept household, there's always a saucer (&quot;<bf>blyudce</bf>&quot;
 or &quot;<bf>blyudechko</bf>&quot; is the Russian expression) beneath the
 cup or the mug, whenever we pour anything thereinto. It is a wise
 custom, for it saves you from many inconveniences resulting from
 spilled zavarka or kipyatok.  
</p>
<p>
If you have enough of them, it would be a manifestation of your
 good manners to serve tea with a saucer under each cup, so that your
 guests can put their wet teaspoons there. 
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, it makes a lot of sense to keep an additional saucer
 under the samovar's spout in order to save the table from dipping
 hot water. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, as seen in many Russian paintings, kids often drink
 tea directly from a saucer. The reason is the following: 
</p>
<p>
The pace of cooling is roughly proportional to the surface of
 the liquid over its volume. Therefore, tea cools much faster if served
 in a saucer rather than in a cup. Now, Russians prefer to drink their
 tea <it>hot</it>, while children can easily scald their lips or tongues with
 such a hot liquid. However, tea drinking is a community rite, so
 it would be inappropriate to let the juniors wait until their tea
 cools down while the elders drink. Hence the saucer. 
</p>
<sect1>
The Podstakannik 
<p>
The <bf>podstakannik</bf> is basically a -- usually metallic -- holder with
 a handle for handleless glasses. It is much easier to wash a plain
 glass than a mug. Thus, such a device is just the right choice for
 a practical hacker. Many think, that it is the traditional Russian
 way to serve the tea, but in fact it is neither traditional nor Russian;
 First podstakanniks showed up on German railroads, exactly for their
 above mentioned practical value. However, as it often happens with
 customs adopted from former adversaries (see also the Japanese <bf>Matryoshka</bf>
 doll), it gained extreme popularity throughout Russia and gradually
 became characteristic of Russia. Someday, even &quot;<bf>beysbollka</bf>&quot;
 might become a traditional Russian headgear. Who knows? 
</p>
<p>
If you decide to purchase a podstakannik, pay attention to the
 material: although the most expensive and decorated ones are made
 of silver, I would not recommend them (except for showing off your
 wealth and ignorance); the heat conductivity of silver (approx. 420J/mKs)
 is too high, thus the handle becomes unbearably hot in a very short
 time. The best choice is stainless steel (50J/mKs) or brass (90J/mKs).
 Plastic? Please...  
</p>
<p>
<descrip>
 <tag>
Note:</tag>The metric unit for heat conductivity is the <bf>Joule/(meter*Kelvin*second)</bf>,
 the imperial unit would, therefore, be something like <bf>calories/(foot*Fahrenheit*hour)</bf>
 or <bf>horsepower/(inch*Fahrenheit)</bf>; the conversion is left as an exercise
 to the reader. 
</descrip>
</p><p>
Most Russian-made podstakanniks are decorated with some theme.
 A hacker's choice could be the one commemorating the greatest hack
 ever: the 1957 launch of <it>Sputnik-1</it>, the first artificial satellite
 of our planet. 
</p>
<p>
Aside from protecting your hands from the heat and alleviating
 the burden of dish-washing, podstakanniks contribute a great deal
 of stability to the glass. Therefore, Russian railroads serve the
 tea in glasses with podstakanniks, and so do the operators of ferries
 and luxurious liners. And so does our Navy, of course. 
</p>
<p>
You can sample the best railroad tea in Russia on the <bf>Krasnaya
 Strela</bf> (<em>Red Arrow</em>) train that connects St. Petersburg, the capital
 of Russian hackerdom with Moscow, the city of Tetris (and the capital
 of the Russian Federation, by coincidence). This is a nightly train
 with very comfortable sleeping cars, where you can fix those last
 two bugs in your project, while sipping on delicious tea. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, it is worth noting that aside from samovars, some beautiful
 podstakanniks are also manufactured in Tula. Check, for example,
 those from TCW (Tula Cartridge Works, <htmlurl url="http://tcwammo.tula.ru" name="http://tcwammo.tula.ru">). If you need a few dozen
 extra slugs for your AK-47M, they can probably help you as well.

Troubleshooting 
<p>
In this chapter, we will review the most common problems that
 emerge in the process of tea-making and the solutions thereof. Those
 having obvious solutions, such as changing the spiral if the samovar
 doesn't heat the water are omitted. Rather, we will focus on issues
 that are not as trivial and require some knowledge beyond common
 sense.
