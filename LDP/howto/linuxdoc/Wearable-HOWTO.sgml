      <abstract>
Nomadism is one of the major trends of our society, now most of the people
can work with a laptop computer, but few did the next step: to live,
or if you prefer to wear one computer that is a wearable.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you". 

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.


2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
entitled "Endorsements."


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.



7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See
http:///www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

    <sect>Foreword
      <p>
I am not a guru in wearable computing, simply after some years
using HP95LX and HP200LX palmtop computers more like  wearables than like a PDA ( thanks to DOS
5, the HP200LX even allowed me to do a semester CS project using turbo pascal
while commuting in  
the subway ),  and living with a palm IIIx and a laptop running Linux,
to me the next step is having a wearable running Linux, thus I have
spent more than a year reading various informations on wearable and
taking a little part in the wear-hard mailing list. As more an more
people will be interested in the wearable concept I have decided to 
start this HOWTO in order to help them ( At the time of this writing
I am building my own 
wearable using my laptop ( Toshiba 430CDT ) with a twiddler keyboard, emacspeak, 
and camcorders batteries. )
      <p>
Some people may, at least, be surprised to find the &quot;In the army now&quot;
section so I would like to explain my position: I am trying to write this
HOWTO both as a journalist and a scientist would do: this implies as a 
journalist to
look for information from every source available, and as a scientist
to be neutral: and as the US Army is willing to purchase more than
30.000 units one can hardly overlook this user group.
This document is  intended to be the
starting point of a long term work. If you have any information ( that
can be checked ) that you think is of interest, do not hesitate
contact me. 
      <p>


    <sect>What is a Wearable anyway ? 
      <p>
Well, as it name implies a wearable is a computer you are supposed to
wear, actually very few wearables fill this definition. On a more
practical point of view one can define a wearable as a computer you can
use on the run relying only on its  power supply ( see the power
supply section for more information ). So with such a definition PDAs, 
palmcomputers, customized laptops are wearables too. As Wearable
computing is a new field, there is no standard definition for a
Wearable computer, but you may find Professor Steve Mann's definition very
. To me medical devices such as pacemakers too are Wearable computers
and they don't fit in Professor Steve Mann's <url
url="http://wearcomp.org/wearcompfaq.htm" 
	  name="definition"> 
 ( actually Professor Steve Mann is one of the Pionneers in Wearable
 computing ) On the Wearcomp website there is also a  <url
 url="hthttp://wearcomp.org/wearcompfaq.html" 
	  name=" FAQ "> trying to
 define what a Wearable is.  
      <p>
I am not a specialist in wearables, simply I have a very strong
interest in nomadic computing and I studying a lot its implementations
both from a technical point of view and from the way nomadic computing
is going to change our every day life and the way we interacts as we
are getting more and more connected.

    <sect>Advocacy
      <p>
Some people may want to know why you want to build a wearable or you may have
to sell your idea to the people who are responsible for the purchase.
Here are some ideas you may use.
      <p>
      <sect1>Why ?
	<p>
Because, you want to experiment by yourself, because you think that
Human Computer Interaction is not a matter of designing the n-th
windowmanager, because you feel that enhanced reality is the cutting
edge of your evolution. 
	<p>

      <sect1>The Wearable concept is not a revolution, it is just an evolution.
	<p>
Some people are afraid of revolutionary or so called products, thus
the good news is that the wearable may look like a revolutionary
concept but it is actually just an evolution of the computing hardware.
Let me explain that~: At first there was the Mainframe, then came the
desktop computer enabling people to work in their office, latter the
PC enabled these people to work at home too, as time passed the
portable PC enabled people to work in a Hotel room, or everywhere they 
could find a power plug ( yes an Osborne or an IBM's convertible were
definitively not laptop computers ), at the same time some pocket
computers appeared on the market : Sharp PC1500, Canon X07, Casio
PB100 then the first one weighted less and less, the second one
disappeared but the LCD screen was, with other things their legacy
allowing the laptop to emerge, as the laptop went mainstream, 
its size went smaller allowing people to work in the train, at the
library ..., then palmtop PC's such as the HP95LX and PDA's appeared,
( at this time the most successful is
the PalmPilot family and its clones ) allowing people to work on the
move, so the wearable is just the next step in this move towards
miniaturization. 
( If you want to learn more about Laptops and Linux you should read
the Laptop-HOWTO, the latest version can be found at Werner's Heuser 
<url
	    url="http://www.snafu.de/~wehe/index_li.html"
	    name=" Homepage "> )
      <sect1>The Wearable may give its user an edge.
	<p> 
In today's competitive world it is very important to get an edge over
the other company, thus for example in a plane repair company the
engineers who are using wearables do not waste time in asking for
blueprints but instead have the blueprint and the technical data at
will while performing their job, thus they will be able to repair the
planes faster. You may choose an example in your job.

      <sect1>The Wearable concept: a stealth menace.
	<p>
When they made their first appearance on the market, some products or technologies
were, to say the least, less than perfect. This is a stealth menace,
if you read Clayton Christensen's book "The innovator's dilemma: when
new technologies cause great firms to fail" or Andy's Grove "Only the
paranoid survives" you will see that some corporations that relies on
a product and that have a king of the hill may fall down because they
overlooked a new product/technology that was clumsy at its beginning
and was at first in a market niche, then the contender took over the market.

      <sect1>Wearable computing: an emerging industry.
	<p>
The people who decide to fund your project are not always very found about technical
details, thus you will have to use other arguments, otherwise your pet 
project will be sent to /dev/null.
If one reads again chapter 2 of AP Sloan's book: "My years with
General Motors" it is obvious that the Wearable industry is 
going into the same changes as did the automobile industry in the US
at the turn of the century~: it turned from a Hobby with some small
manufacturers to a mass market Industry. It took nearly 30 years to
the automobile industry to change, but the wearable industry should
have done this changes in less than 5 years, so if they don't invest
on this product others will do. 

    <sect>What CPU ?
      <p>
      <sect1>PDA based Wearables
	<p>
Usually they use non Intel CPU ( except the HP95/100/200LX )
See the PalmPilot : a new breed of wearables section.
	<p>
      <sect1>PC/104 and laptop based Wearables.
	<p>
Theses devices are using usually an Intel or Intel compatible CPU.
	<p>
	<sect2>What is PC/104 ?
	  <p>
PC/104 is an industrial standard, for PC based systems
that can be stacked together in order to create an embedded system.
The footprint of theses boards is 4"x4" so as you can see it is a
good base in order to start a wearable project.
	  <p>
	<sect2>What about PC/104-plus ?
	  <p>
It is a PCI addition to the PC/104 standard.
you can read the <url
	      url="http://www.controlled.com/pc104faq"
	      name="PC-104 FAQ">
<sect1>Transmeta's processor the Crusoe.
<p>
It seems that Transmeta hasn't build the fastest chip on the
market but has indeed focused on power saving making its processor and
ideal choice for a wearable project, moreover it seems that
motherboards will be available very soon as Phoenix Bios released
their Bios for this chip.
      <sect1>Misc
	<p>
Last year there were some alpha based Multia sold for around $100,
but it seemed AFAIK that nobody ever managed to build a wearable
around one of theses devices.

    <sect>Power supply
      <p>
There is plenty of choice as long as you use batteries. But be careful 
__NEVER__ use liquid acid filled batteries it is a Health Hazard for
this application. 
    <sect>OS.
      <p>
For the people whose Wearable is based on a PDA, there is little
choice : most of the time they have to do with the PDA's manufacturer
OS, AFAIK Linux on Psion series 5 is not mainstream.
a commercial solution called WindStone primary targeted to palmpilots
with a project to port it to ARM based computers it is made by
 <url url="http://www.oski.co.kr/"
	  name="OSK">, so
 and see. For <url
	  url="http://www.freebsd.org/~imp/pdamips.html"
	  name=" Mips based PDA "> type; some of them seem to be able to 
run <url url="http://www.netbsd.org"
	  name="NetBSD"> ( it is a member of the *BSD family of
	  unices running on a lot of platforms ). 

      <p>
For those using a PC derivative, the choice seems to be between
Microsoft products or Linux, 
Well,  Microsoft products are not exactly the best choice and
DEBIAN/GNU Linux is the winner ( I don't think that for general
purposes one has to use a posix .4 compliant kernel ).
      <p>
There is another contender 
<url url="http://www.qnx.com"
	  name="QNX">, but is more industrial oriented, so for
hobby or research it is not the best choice.
    
    <sect>The Sulawesi project.
      <p>
This project deals as well with input modalities and with output
modalities thus its section is just before the Input/Output part of
this document.
 
It is meant to accept input from different modalities and to do its
input to a number of different modalities, this is written in Java;
The good news is that it is highly portable, the bad news is that
today a JVM is a memory and resource hog ( but, to me, Java and the related
technologies such as Jini, just like the
wearable, is a stealth menace ). 
One of the nice features of this project is the fact that, because of
a clever design, it can deal with with a great input and output
modalities that exists today, and when new modalities one hadn't even
think about will be available, it should be able to deal with them in
a very short time and with little effort.

Today, it can accept input from a GPS too.

Usually theses devices are on the wearer's forearm or wrist.
	  <p>
The <url url="http://www.pfuca.com/products/hhkb/hhcindex.html"
	      name="WristPC"> Keyboard  and the 
<url url="http://www.ivpgi.com/1accessory.htm"
	      name="Arm mount micro keyboard"> from the Phoenix Group
Inc. 
are typical from this concept.

	<sect2>One hand keyboard.
	  <p>
IMHO it is the best concept because it doesn't require you to look at
the keyboard while typing is the less intrusive when you
have to deal with other people, and in order to be accepted by other
a Wearable wearer's must have the lowest visual signature.
	  <p>
The archetype of this concept is the <url
	      url="http://www.handykey.com"
	      name="Twiddler"> and all of its clones.
 <p>
At first using a twiddler may seem to be a little bit confusing. The
very first thing to do is to read the manual ( don't forget to plug
the keyboard or the PS/2 adaptator or your twiddler won't work because
it will get no power supply. ) The reference card may, at first, seem confusing
because when you are working with your twiddler you are behind the
buttons and the reference card show you the buttons from the front
side not from the rear so you will have to switch right and left. When
you have passed theses steps you will quickly learn how to use it and
IMHO it feels very comfortable to use. The way the integrated mouse
operates is very natural too.


    <sect>Audio Output
      <p>
When your system doesn't output too much data, or in order to signal
some special events an audio output can do the job.
Most laptops come with a Sound Blaster compatible sound card and a lot 
of PC-104 cards are sold with such a sound card on board or you should 
buy a sound module. The next step is to redirect your text output to a 
text_to_speak program.
      <P>
As a lot of input is done using emacs, it seems to be a good idea to
use  <url

the software, is <url

	  <p>
It is also possible to use a 4 lines LCD display connected to the
serial port of your laptop ( numerous paper or online electronics
magazine offer schematics ).

	<sect2>PDA type
	  <p>
PDA's seem to be a cheap and efficient way of sending and displaying
data for a wearable, actually any PDA with a VT100 emulation program
and a serial link can be used effectively as a terminal ( I have
successfully used my HP200LX running 
<url

      <sect1>Do it yourself.
	<p>
As wearable computing is in its very early beginning you should make
various experiments and share them with your peers.
Doing this with an open and versatile OS such as Linux should give you 
a lot of fun ( after all, desktop computer is just a plain vanilla
computer), because you play with both the OS and the hardware.
If you are unsure of the technical decisions you are going to make, you
can start with a proven design. On the net you can find the
specifications of some wearable systems thus you will not have to
reinvent the wheel and you will avoid some pitfalls. ( the designs are
sorted by alphabetical order ).

<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
The 
<url

    <sect>PalmPilot and its clone  ( IBM, HandSpring, TRG ): a new breed of wearables.
      <p>
<sect1>The palm family.
<p>
The PalmPilot family and its clone is a hit among PDAs, but less known 
is the fact that it is more than a PDA it is one of the first off the shelves wearable.
You can connect it to your cell phone, 
When on the move you may need an input device more convenient than
Graffiti: a keyboard for example, one device exists that allow you to
plug a PS/2 keyboard in your palm:
Happy Hacking cradle Specially for the Palm.
      <p>
<url url="http://www.pfuca.com/products/hhkb/hhcindex.html" 
	  name="PFU">
Happy Hacking sells a PS/2 adapter for the Palm, thus 
one should be able to hook any PS/2 keyboard on this device.
It is battery ( 2 AA ) powered.
      <p>
It seems that someone has managed to get a twiddler keyboard working
with the PalmPilot.
If you want to do land navigation it exists an electronic compass you
can plug into your palm it is called Palm Navigator and it is
manufactured by 
<url
	  url="http://www.precisionnav.com"
	  name="Precision Navigation">
They even sell a weather station.

If you have more money to spend or want more precision you can
purchase a GPS receiver called Earthmate; it is manufactured by 
<url
	  url="http://www.delorme.com"
	  name="Precision Navigation">
Some of you may want a software only solution: this can be done.
If you have some highly specialized needs like commuting without
having the subway map and want a readily made solution you can use a
program like Route Expert, I use it on a daily basis, it works great
with Paris's subway and I will test it with Berlin's subway at the end 
of the year ( of course it exists other programs but this one is the
one I am using ). I guess everyone can find the North using the sun and a
wirtswatch, a PalmPilot can do it with more precision using readymade
programs such as T.J's Sun-Compass ( once again there exists other
programs but this one is the one I am using ).
      <p>
The most important with the PalmPilot for the Linux community is the
fact that there exists two ports of Linux for it ( DragonBall is a
member of the 68000 family after all ). One is GPLed

You can find more information at :
<url
	  url="http://www.uclinux.org"
	  name="uClinux">

the second one is commercial, it is based in Korea.
<url
	  url="http://www.oski.co.kr"
	  name="WindStone">
 it is based on uClinux and it is coming  with its own GUI and
widgets.

Thus with the next generation of Palms, the CPU speed will be twice
today's speed, and with Linux on board we will be able to run a lot of 
software that are hardware independent and have been written for
today's x86 Linux based wearables.  
<p>
<sect1>PDAs runing Linux.
<p>
Samsung displayed a PDA named the<url
	  url="http://www.sem.samsung.co.kr/eng/product/digital/pda/"
	  name="Yopi "> runing Linux.
 It is an ARMLinux based PDA, 32 MB RAM, featuring a voice recorder, mp3
player,IrDa port, compact flash slot, a 4" color TFT and HandWritting
Recognition, plus Serial and USB interface. Word has spread that it
should be sold this summer but unti then wait and see. 
<p>
It exists a <url
	  url="http://www.freebsd.org/~imp/pdamips.html"
	  name=" Mips based PDA info Center"> This site focuses both
	  on NetBSD and LinuxCE on MIPS based PDAs.
<p>
You can find some information on the <url

	  name=" LinuxCE "> port; and you may wish to read the <url
	  url="http://linuxce.2gn.com/faq"
	  name=" LinuxCE FAQ">
	   With theses PDAs one should be able to consider
	  building a 
	  nice PDA based Wearable. 
<p>
    <sect>How to carry my wearable ?
      <p>
Depending on your wearable's family ( eg Palm, palmtop computer,
laptop based, PC/104 ) there seem to be 3 convenient ways of carrying
it around.
You can carry it on tour wrist, or in a backpack or you can hang it on 
your waistband.
      <p>
    <sect>Applications with Wearables.
      <p>
As a rule of thumb the first people who are going
to use extensively the wearables are the people
whose work is a matter of life and death.
      <p>
      <sect1>In the army now.
	<p>
It is very important in an army to have an edge other the enemy,
that is what we have always seen in history, and moreover the army
is known to spend vast amount of money in order to get this edge.
	<p>
Some years ago the infantryman was ordered to carry different  pieces of ordnance that came 
from different sources and were not part of a whole thing, and to try
to do his best with theses ( looks like Frankenstein to me ). With theses 
new projects the infantryman is the centerpiece of a coherent,
complementary weapons and equipment system.

In Australia there is a program called Land 125 Soldier Combat System
            ( formerly &quot;Wundurra&quot; 
            ( the aboriginal word for Warrior ) ), there is some information
 on 
<url

<url 
url="http://www.atse.org.au/"
name="ATSE " >this project should be on phase 2 on year 2000/2001.
	    
According to DTSO the soldiers should have intra-section radios, night
vision and sighting capability and head up display.

In France there is a project called FELIN ( Fantassin &agrave; Equipement et
Liaison Integr&eacute;es ( Foot soldier with integrated equipment and links ) 
) 
	  <p>
in order to enhance the efficiency of the soldier a set of devices had
been developed with very careful limitations : historically the foot
soldier has been a beast of burden, thus the FELIN project wishes 
to limit its load at 25kg. The soldier has got a radio link, a
computer and a camera on his weapon ( allowing him to open fire from
cover ). The display is done  with a monocular HMD.

The FIST ( Future Integrated Soldier Technology ) project:
Early tests were conducted on Salisbury Plain to determine if the
soldier could access information either 'Head Up' ( in a helmet
display ), 'Head Down' ( on a wrist mounted display ), via a palmtop
computer or if necessary  a map  

lessons learned ( in L'armement issue 67 September 1999 )
<itemize>
		  <item>There is no scope for enhancing soldier performance through the
provision of tactical information unless the soldier can access
information 'on the move'</item>
		  <item>The preference, both by day and night was the helmet display.</item>
		</itemize>
The FIST Digitization Trials will be conducted on Salisbury Plain in
June and November 2000. The June trial addresses information flow, the
November trial will address the benefits of enhanced information to
determine if there is a consequent increase in the 'Tempo of Operation'.

featuring an integrated GPS receiver</item> 
			<item>The Protective Clothing and Individual Equipment Subsystem

The location of each squad member will be available through the IHAS,
as well as digitized maps and tactical information. 
Every soldier will have an integrated GPS as well as video recording capabilities.
Of course the soldier will have night vision capability as well as
deported sighting. Tests should take place during year 2000.

( There is even a FAQ and pictures ).
AFAIK this is going to be the biggest test for the wearable concept
because the Army is planning to purchase 34000 units plus spares.
</item>
		  <item>The navy.
	    <p>
During the summer 1999 news poured that the US Navy tested the Virtual Retinal
Display at Hawaii. The explanation is that there doesn't seem to be
enough space in the fighting ships because of the numerous CRT, so it
is conceivable for the crew to wear VRDs 
	    <p>
Needless to say, that some very low profile and highly specialized
units should have adopted the wearable concept but as far as we cannot 
have evidence we can only speculate on that.
 </item>

      <sect1>At the hospital
	<p>
The <url
	    url="http://www.mvis.com"
	    name="Microvison">'s VRD has been
<url
	    url="http://www.mvis.com/2-medi.htm"
	    name="delivered "> to the Wallace Kettering
Neuroscience Institute, Dayton Ohio, for neurosurgery
applications. 
This is not a full featured wearable solution but it is
a big step toward the adoption of wearables in health care activity. 
( on the website you can view a <url
	    url="http://www.mvis.com/dr_pov4jpg.htm"
	    name="simulated image">  ).


      <sect1>With the firefighters
	<p>
Firefighters are using thermal cameras in order to see through the
smoke, in the next years theses devices should be miniaturized and 
with a wearable firefighters should have both hands free and will have 
real time access to data such as the map of the building and numerous
helpful informations.

      <sect1>Wearable for the disabled.
	<p>
One can easily think that a wearable computer can be very helpfull for 
the disabled people, for example for blind people a wearable with a GPS 
receiver, some maps of the surroundings and even more, interacting with 
its surroundings by means of active beacons can be a very good
substitute for a dog, the elements exists for a long time. 

 This should be easily done : the linux comunity has good text to speech
applications, voice recognition is quite ready for this application
, the IrDA or Modem radio drivers are OK, the same applies 
to the GPS programs, we have to develop an electronic blind walking
stick in order to detect the obstacles at a much reater range and
last, but not the least to convince the autorities.

    <sect>A borg's life.
      <p>
This section deals with Human-Human interaction. 
As the wearable is quite new for the layman one has to expect some
strange reactions from the other people.
When I go out and read my PalmPilot's screen while walking or in the
subway people have one of the following reactions :
<itemize>
	  <item>No reaction: because they are in their own world or because they 
don't care.
</item>
	  <item>Curiosity: they come to me and ask me questions like "what it
is", "what are you doing with it" and "how much does it cost ?"
</item>
	  <item>Disdain : they may think I want to draw attention.
</item>
	  <item>Hostility/Fear : "this guy is nut: avoid him".
</item>
	</itemize>
Steve Mann Gave an interview in the New Scientist magazine and as he
was one of the first to test the waters, so he has a long experience in
this field.
The second problem is that the wearable's hardware is quite expensive and some
predators will spot a new device that can be easily stolen and sold
at a good price, or just in order to have one of them. 
As a conclusion you have to be very cautious.
