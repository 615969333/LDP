Background
 <sect1>
Digital Camera Technology--How Things Work
 <p>
Digital cameras work with the same basic concept as a traditional camera.
 They have a viewfinder or LCD screen to show the image prior to taking a photograph,
 a lens with a shudder behind it to allow the light from the subject to hit
 a light sensative material. However, this is where most of the similarities
 end.
 </p>
 <p>
Digital cameras use a CCD (Charged Coupled Device) to sense the colors
 of the light and their intensity. The CCD can be likened to a very find piece
 of graphing paper, with thousands of little squares (transistors) to which
 sense the differences between the colors. There are three types of transistors
 used in commonplace CCDs, red, green and blue. Each transistor then passes
 the color and intensity it sensed to and Analog-to-digital converter (ADC).
 The ADC then converts the information passed to it by the transistors into
 a digital format, or binary 1's and 0's. The digital output of the ADC is then
 passed to a Digital Signal Processor (DSP). The DSP adjusts the contrast and
 other image details to get the perfect look and then compresses the data into
 a file format like JPEG (Joint Photographics Expert Group). 
 </p>
 <p>
Digital cameras may also have the ability to do an optical or a digital
 zoom on an image. An optical zoom is when a lens is used to get a closer look
 at the subject. A digital zoom is used to enhance the optical zoom for a larger
 image even though the maximum size has been attained via optical zoom. Even
 though an image can be resized later, it is suggested to use the built in digital
 zoom of the camera at this point before any compression has been done to the
 image. File formats like JPEG tend to degrade in quality when resized more
 so then when the image is resized by the camera's software. This is due to
 artifacts left behind due to the compression.

DC265
 <p>
The DC265 provides mechanisms for data transfer via standard RS232 serial
 port, USB (Universal Serial Bus) and IrDA (infrared) interface. Additionally,
 images may be offloaded from the camera through the removal of the camera's
 Compact Flash Card and use of a Compact Flash PC Card Adapter in a PC Card
 reader or notebook PC Card slot. Currently this camera is supported by OpenDiS
 for USB and Serial data transfer.
 </p>
 <sect2>
Serial Camera Control
 <p>
Additional notes regarding transfer of data from the DC265 camera using
 RS232 serial support will be added in a future version of this HOWTO. See the
 OpenDiS subsection of the Software section of the HOWTO for information regarding
 serial camera control.

 <sect2>
2.2.14 Kernel USB Support
 <p>
At the moment the USB implementation in the 2.2.x series is insufficient
 and substantially out of date. As such, most USB devices are unsupported natively
 with the included drivers. However there is a patch available for the 2.2.14
 kernel.
 </p>
 <p>
What software is needed (if not already present):

Kernel Devices
 <p>
The following is a bash shell script designed to create all 16 Kodak devices
 for use with both the current 2.3.x kernel series and 2.2.14 with the current
 USB backport. Copy the text below into a file named MakeKodakDev, then make
 that file executable by typing 'chmod +x MakeKodakDev' and then run the script
 ./MakeKodakDev as root (or su'd to root) it will create the devices so they
 don't have to be made individually by hand.
 </p>
 <p>
It creates as per the dc2xx.txt file in the kernel documentation the following
 16 devices:
 </p>
 <p>
/dev/kodak00 type=character major=180 minor=80
 </p>
 <p>

Compact Flash PC Card Adapter
 <p>
This section is for those who wish to utilize maximum data transfer rate
 and save the battery power in the camera's batteries. This method of picture
 access only allows for storage, retrieval, and deletion of images on a Compact
 Flash Card. These instructions are tested with a Kodak 16 MB Picture Card and
 a SanDisk CompactFlash PC Card Adapter on a Dell Inspiron 7000 notebook computer.
 </p>
 <p>

This document assumes a working knowledge of kernel and program compiling.
 If unfamiliar with the process it is strongly suggested to go and read the
 <url url="http://howto.tucows.com/LDP/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html" name="Kernel-HOWTO">.
 </p>
 <p>
Select the following to be built as either modules or part of your kernel:
 </p>
 <p>
 <enum>
  <item>
DOS FAT fs support
  <item>
VFAT (Windows-95) fs support
 </enum>
</p> <p>
Reboot the system and then load the created modules each time access to
 the compact flash card is desired if the support is not compiled into the kernel.
 To load the modules do the following:
 </p>
 <p>
 <verb>
/sbin/insmod /lib/modules/&dollar;(uname -r)/fat.o
/sbin/insmod /lib/modules/&dollar;(uname -r)/vfat.o
 </verb>
</p> <p>
Compile and configure PCMCIA-CS. This part of the process is beyond the
 scope of this document, however there is a document with such information that
 can be found in the <url url="ftp://sourceforge.org/pcmcia/doc/PCMCIA-HOWTO.html" name="PCMCIA-HOWTO."> There is also most likely a pre-packaged version for the
 distribution of GNU/Linux the computer running. This step can be greatly simplified
 if a pre-packaged version is used.
 </p>
 <p>
Using the Compact Flash PC Card Adapter:
 </p>
 <p>
Create a directory to mount the Compact Flash Card to.
 </p>
 <p>
 <verb>
mkdir /flashcard
 </verb>
</p> <p>
Insert the Compact Flash Card into the Compact Flash PC Card Adapter (both
 should face the same direction).
 </p>
 <p>
Insert the Compact Flash PC Card Adapter into the PC-Card slot of the notebook
 computer.
 </p>
 <p>
Mount the Compact Flash Card PC Card Adapter to /flashcard (The Compact
 Flash Card PC Card Adapter is assigned its device by figuring out how many
 IDE controllers are on the system, and then assigning it the next device. For
 example, if a system were to have 2 IDE controllers, and would thus have /dev/hda
 /dev/hdb /dev/hdc and /dev/hdd assigned to the current controllers, the Compact
 Flash Card PC Card Adapter would be assigned /dev/hde1.).
 </p>
 <p>
 <verb>
mount -t vfat /dev/hde1 /flashcard
 </verb>
</p> <p>
From this point the files can be copied, moved, deleted, and renamed as
 done on a normal filesystem. Information regarding file management commands
 may be found in the documentation included with the OS distribution used, such
 as man pages. The manual pages which list the commands to use to do the above
 procedures can be accesses by typing the following to get the command's respective
 manual page entry: 'man cp', 'man mv', 'man rm'. Before removing the Compact
 Flash Card PC Card Adapter remember to unmount it with the following command.
 
 </p>
 <p>
 <verb>
umount /flashcard
 </verb>
</p> <p>
The Compact Flash Card PC Card Adapter can be removed from the PC Card
 Reader and the Compact Flash Card and be removed from the Compact Flash Card
 PC Card Adapter.

                             &quot;usb&quot;, or &quot;irda&quot;.  Normally, device type
                             can be deduced from DEV and need not be
                             specified
  -i, --irda                 Same as --type=irda
  -s, --serial               Same as --type=serial
  -u, --usb                  Same as --type=usb

  poweroff      Turn the camera off
 </verb>
</p> <sect2>
Usage Examples
 <p>
USB: 
 </p>
 <p>
Special USB notes. The USB stack has been ever changing in the developmental
 kernels and as such works differently from time to time. In playing with the
 latest developmental kernel released the camera tends to show up on /dev/kodak00
 or /dev/kodak01, independent of the fact that only one camera is connected.
 The support for these devices is all fairly new, so expect to have to play
 with it to get it working. The following should allow one to download all images
 from the camera to the working directory with a USB connection. Make sure that
 the camera is in connect mode.
 </p>
 <p>
 <verb>
ks -d /dev/kodak00 download
 </verb>
</p> <p>
Serial:
 </p>
 <p>
Serial support does work and as such the following command should allow
 one to download all images from the camera into their current working directory.
 Modify the serial port device name as necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
 <verb>
ks -d /dev/ttyS0 download
 </verb>
</p> <p>
IrDA:
 </p>
 <p>
Infrared support is not yet supported by OpenDiS. As such no example can
 be provided. The reason it is not supported yet is that the protocol differs
 from that of the USB/serial protocols. USB and Serial use very similar if not
 the same protocol for their functionality.
 </p>
 <sect1>
Digita Operating Environment- Command Device Protocol Python Script
 <p>
This Python script written by Sai Lai Lo of AT&amp;T Cambridge Laboratories
 allows for download of images from Kodak Digital Cameras running DigitaOS and
 using USB for transfer. Some have problems with this script and some don't.
 However it is nice to cover all bases.

 one above is derived has to be edited to remove leading text to work. 
 </p>
 <p>
The script depends on /dev/kodak existing due to the way older kernels
 accessed the Kodak Digital Camera USB Device. A symbolic link must be created
 between the actual device the camera is on and /dev/kodak. If the camera is
 on /dev/kodak00 the symbolic link needed can be created with the following
 command:
 </p>
 <p>
 <verb>
ln -s /dev/kodak00 /dev/kodak
 </verb>
</p> <p>
Be sure to substitute in the proper device name instead of kodak00 if the
 camera was not assigned kodak00. To list all files on the camera run the following
 command:
 </p>
 <p>
 <verb>
python cdp.py
 </verb>
</p> <p>
To download a single image from the camera run the following command:
 </p>
 <p>
 <verb>
python cdp.py 2:DC265_01/P0000748.JPG
 </verb>
</p> <p>
That command will download the image P0000748.JPG to the directory DC265_01
 in the current directory. A quick and easy command to download all the images
 from the camera would be:
 </p>
 <p>
 <verb>
for file in &dollar;(python cdp.py); do python cdp.py &dollar;file; done
 </verb>
</p> <p>
This is just a few of the many ways such a script can work. It is possible
 to use the above command in a larger shell script to automate downloading the
 images from the camera, converting the images to another format, resizing the
 images, creating a web page automatically, and many many others. The options
 are endless when it comes to scripts like this.

Other Useful Mailing Lists
 <sect2>
Linux-USB
 <p>
<url url="http://lists.suse.com/archives/linux-usb/" name="Linux-USB">
 </p>
 <p>
The Linux-USB mailing list is a very active mailing list pertaining to
 all aspects of USB and Linux. Here one will find the most recent patches for
 the USB code in the Linux kernel. There is also good discussion on support
 of digital cameras from time to time. Overall a great list to peek at every
 week or so.
 </p>
 <p>
To subscribe to this list send a blank email to linux-usb-subscribe@suse.com.
 A confirmation email that must be replied to will then be sent back. Either
 send a reply to the email address in the reply-to: section of the email, or
 the address listed in the confirmation message itself. To unsubscribe from
 the list send a blank email to linux-usb-unsubscribe@suse.com. This action
 will then have to be confirmed with the same method used for confirming subscription
 to the mailing list. For a list of other useful commands send an email to linux-usb-info@suse.com.
 </p>
 <sect2>
Linux-kernel
 <p>
<url url="http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel%40vger.rutgers.edu/" name="Linux-kernel">
 </p>
 <p>
The linux-kernel mailing list is a very high traffic mailing list detailing
 all aspects of the Linux kernel. This list is only for those who wish to have
 more information than the Linux-USB list and the gPhoto-Kodak lists contain.
 However, it covers much more of a broad spectrum of topics than Kodak digital
 camera support under Linux. 
 </p>
 <p>
Before posting or subscribing to the Linux-kernel mailing list is is highly
 suggested reading the <url url="http://www.tux.org/lkml/" name="Linux-kernel mailing list FAQ">. It could save much time and embarrassment. It also
 contains useful information on who certain individuals are in the Linux community
 in relation to their standing on the list.
 </p>
 <p>
To subscribe to the list (remember, it is about 200 emails a day) send
 an email to majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu with "subscribe linux-kernel username@mailserver"
 in the body of the message where username is the email account to be used and
 mailserver is the name of the mail server. Remember to omit the quotation marks.
 </p>
 <p>
An alternative to joining the list would be to get the list in digest format.
 This is a better format to many as it is a few emails a day rather than several
 hundred. One drawback of this is that it is not as easy to discuss the issues
 with the mailing list as most mail clients don't know how to deal with the
 digest in its format besides dealing with it like plain text. To subscribe
 to the digest send an email to majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu with the line "subscribe
 linux-kernel-digest username@mailserver" in the body of the message. Where username
 is the email account username to be used and mailserver is the name of the
 mail server. Remember to omit the quotation marks.
 </p>
 <p>
Unsubscribing from the mail list is as easy as subscribing. Just send an
 email to majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu with the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel"
 in the body of the message, or alternately "unsubscribe linux-kernel-digest"
 if subscribed to the digest. And again, remember to omit the quotation marks.
 </p>
 <p>
Rather than subscribing to this list it would be highly suggested to search
 through the archive which is accessible via the URL listed above. Another alternative
 is the <url url="http://kt.linuxcare.com/" name="Kernel Traffic">site. It contains a good overview of the weeks kernel developmental
 works and discussions in a summary format.
