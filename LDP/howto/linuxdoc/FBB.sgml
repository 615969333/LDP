<nidx>linux windows nt amateur packet radio</nidx>
This mini-HOWTO covers the installation and use of
the most popular amateur packet-radio BBS 
software FBB. That software works under Linux, DOS
and Windows operating systems. It serves as a
bulletin board system (BBS), a mailbox for
personal messages, a database for various texts,
documents and binary files, a server for small
useful calculations etc. Packet radio is a way of
connecting computers via amateur radio stations.
</abstract>


<sect>INTRODUCTION

<p>
I have been using FBB amateur radio software since
early nineties. It was the time of DOS operating
system, so most of us, system administrators (or, so
called system operators - sysop's), used various 
packet radio software for DOS. Versions of FBB 
packet radio BBS software for DOS, today are 
known as DosFBB. 

<p>
I still administer one DosFBB 
database in the SRV (Amateur Radio Union of 
Vojvodina, a part of SRJ). It is DosFBB v7.00g23
that runs on a 486DX computer with 16 MB of RAM
and Hercules b/w graphics. Since last December,
it runs without any re-boot (excepting some power
failures). Before that, it was a bit tricky to
set up all memory management properly, in order
to avoid "frozen" system. Although this server 
runs under DOS, its "radio clients" don't depend
on that. In fact, users of that DosFBB might run
their client software under DOS, Windows, Linux
or any other operating system that offer amateur
packet radio abilities.

<p>Two years ago, after I got my new box, Pentium 166
with 32 MB of RAM and VGA color graphics, I
switched to a Windows version of FBB (so called
WinFBB). Author of the software, an radio amateur
from France, Jean-Paul F6FBB, has made many 
versions of WinFBB, including 16 bit variant for 
Windows 3.x and Windows 9x as well as 32 bit variant for
Windows NT. I have run both variants until now 
(at the moment it is 16 bit WinFBB v7.00g25 that runs
ok under Windows NT 4.0). 

<p>The main
difference between DosFBB and WinFBB is that the
second one offers you to do other jobs with your
computer, while FBB is running as just any other
application. Beside that, it is always nice to
copy a text from another application (for example,
from an Internet email) and to paste it into a
packet radio message.

<p>In the mean time, I upgraded my system to the
Celeron 400 MHz with 96 MB of RAM and a big hard
disk that has enough room to install Linux and try
LinFBB ...


<sect>INSTALLATION

<p>
<sect1>How to install X11 (Xwindows) version of LinFBB

<p>
<itemize>

<item>First of all, you should have running Linux
      with a GUI installed. I am fully satisfied
      with Gnome GUI but I suppose that KDE will
      be ok too (or any other GUI available).

<p>
<item>Download or copy LinFBB (the main ftp site
      is <url url="http://ftp.f6fbb.org/" name=
      "ftp.f6fbb.org"> but there are many mirror
      sites too). For example, if you get a file
      like <tscreen><verb>x700e_full.tgz</verb></tscreen> 
      it means that it is X11 version 7.00e and it 
      contains all you need in tgz archive to install 
      the BBS. On the other hand, a name like 
      <tscreen><verb>xd700g_full.tgz</verb></tscreen> 
      means that it is not X11 but daemon version 7.00g
      and it is also complete to unpack. Further,
      <tscreen><verb>x700f01.tgz</verb></tscreen> 
      and <tscreen><verb>x700g.tgz</verb></tscreen> 
      are "upgrades" to any previous "full" package.
      For example, after I have upgraded to <tt>x700g.tgz</tt>
      I started to run X11 LinFBB 7.00g (04. August 1998).
      BTW, X11 versions are not maintained anymore, so
      I still run it here. It has some bugs but I like it. 

<p>
<item>Copy the archive file in <bf>/tmp</bf> directory.

<p>
<item>You have to make a "base" directory where
      your FBB will be installed. For example you
      may type: <bf>mkdir /usr/local/fbb</bf> if you want
      FBB to be there. You have to be logged as
      'root' or 'superuser' to install FBB.

<p>
<item>Then, you should locate yourself in that
      directory: <bf>cd /usr/local/fbb</bf>.

<p>
<item>Now, you should unpack the archive:
      <bf>tar xvzf /tmp/x700b25.tgz</bf> (<-- use the right
      name of the archive here).

<p>
<item>When you finished unpacking the archive,
      you may continue installing the software:
      <bf>./install.sh</bf> is the command for that. The
      setup will ask you for the 'base' directory
      where FBB will be installed. If you chose
      <bf>/usr/local/fbb</bf> again, you will be told that
      such directory already exists and all files
      will be overwritten. It is ok, so you should
      answer yes. If everything is ok, you should
      see on the screen that fbb system 
      directories are created. At the beginning
      of that procedure, program will ask you for
      bbs's callsign, name of the city, QTH 
      locator, your name etc. That details will
      become a part of <bf>/usr/local/fbb/init.srv</bf>
      file. 

<p>
<item>After that, you MUST check this file
      <bf>again</bf> manually in order to fix some other 
      details needed (because installation script does
      not fix all parts within that file).

<p>
<item>Well, so far - so good. After you have checked
      all configuration files, you may start the
      software: <bf>./xfbb.sh</bf> (<-- type this within
      an xterm or something similar). When you
      start your BBS for the first time, it will ask
      you to create some files it needs, so you
      should answer "yes" to the questions.

</itemize>

<p>
<sect1>How to install LinFBB in addition to existing WinFBB

<p>
<em>Notice: Folks, you see, at my place, I have a
dual-boot system, consisting of Windows NT and
Linux (each of them having their own partition(s)
and file system). I wanted to have 'independent'
operating systems that won't see each other. So I
made two NT's partitions as NTFS partitions and
rest of the space used Linux as ext2 partitions.
Well, first I have installed WinFBB under NT and X11
LinFBB under Linux. Both of them worked, but there
was a big "problem": I could not share their
system files. You might say: So, what a big deal.
But, my FBB's should serve as packet-radio forwarding 
stations (regardless of which one I boot at the
moment), so it was really needed for new LinFBB 
to "know", for example, the position where WinFBB 
has stopped the mail exchange last time (and vice 
versa, of course).</em>
 
<p>
<itemize>

<item>Well, in order to allow both WinFBB under
      Windows NT and LinFBB under Linux to use
      some common files, it is needed to put these
      files in a place where both operating systems can
      "see". So I do that by re-installing
      WinFBB onto a FAT (FAT16) partition that is
      recognized by NT and Linux too. The best way to do 
      that is to install a "fresh" copy of WinFBB on
      a FAT partition and to copy complete "old" 
      WinFBB from NTFS partition over the fresh 
      installation (whenever you are asked to 
      rewrite existing files, you should answer
      "yes").

<p>
<item>When that is finished, you should have a "clone"
      of the existing old WinFBB, but this time on
      the FAT partition that is visible from under
      Linux. Anyway, you should check if the "new" 
      installation is able to run as the "old" one.

<p>
<item>I could also recommend you to check the file
      tree of WinFBB in order to become more
      familiar with it. The file tree of LinFBB
      is a bit different so it is advisable to
      note various details here and there.

<p>
<item>Some files can't be used as they are under <em>both</em>
      operating systems (without some neccesary
      changes). That's why some file names should
      be renamed (or, at least, you should make
      appropriate copies of some files):

<p>
      <tscreen><verb>
      init.srv    ->  init_w.srv
      forward.sys ->  forw_w.sys
      port.sys    ->  port_w.sys
      protect.sys ->  prot_w.sys
      </verb></tscreen>

<p>
      FBB is able to recognize and accept those renamed files.

<p>
<item>Make a backup of the actual WinFBB (I do this
      by copying the whole WinFBB file structure into
      the other Windows partition that <em>won't</em> be
      shared with Linux, like NTFS one). You'll never
      know when a catastrophe may happen, so as a result,
      you won't be able to start neither of WinFBB or new
      LinFBB. As a precaution, the backup might be the
      easiest way to recover at least the old WinFBB for
      a while (until you configure your new LinFBB, ok?).

<p>
<item>Now, you should restart your machine and boot
      into Linux. Log on as 'root' or make 'su' from a
      user's account.

<p>
<item>Mount a shared FAT directory (where FBB files are):
      <bf>mount -t vfat /dev/hda2 /mnt/win</bf>
      (for example).

<p>
<item>Copy LinFBB archive to <bf>/tmp</bf> directory.

<p>
<item>Position yourself to the 'base' directory:
      <bf>cd /usr/local/fbb</bf> (for example).

<p>
<item>Unpack the archive: <bf>tar xvzf /tmp/filename</bf>.

<p>
<item>Start the installation script <bf>./install.sh</bf>
      and, after asked for the 'base' installation
      directory, chose <bf>/usr/local/fbb</bf>. It doesn't
      matter if the program warns you that such
      directory already exists so existing files
      will be overwritten (by the way, if you
      choose a mounted directory shared with NT,
      many original WinFBB files, located there, would be 
      over-written by LinFBB files, so after returning 
      to Windows, WinFBB might not be functional
      like before).

<p>
<item>Copy <bf>/usr/local/fbb</bf> to <bf>/mnt/win/fbb</bf> but do
      *not* rewrite existing files with the new files 
      having the same names.

<p>
<item>Copy <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/init_w.srv</bf> to
      <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/init_l.srv</bf> file.

<p>
<item>Edit <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/init_l.srv</bf> to what is
      needed for Linux. You may use the existing
      file <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/init.srv</bf> as an example.

<p>
<item>Copy newly edited <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/init_l.srv</bf>
      over the <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/init.srv</bf> (if you do
      not do that, maybe you wouldn't be able to start LinFBB
      using <bf>./xfbb.sh</bf>, like me at first).

<p>
<item>Copy <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/system/port_w.sys</bf> to
      <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/system/port_l.sys</bf> file.

<p>
<item>Edit <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/system/port_l.sys</bf> to
      what is needed for Linux and LinFBB. You may use the
      existing file <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/system/port.sys</bf>
      as an example.

<p>
<item>Edit <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/xfbb.sh</bf> in order to fix
      the right path.

<p>
<item>Ensure that you are in FBB's main directory:
      <bf>cd /mnt/win/fbb</bf> (for example).

<p>
<item>Start the script <bf>./xfbb.sh</bf> to run LinFBB.
      If everything is ok, your LinFBB under Linux
      should run with the same configuration as
      your "old" WinFBB under Windows. From this point,
      both FBB's should behave very similar (actually,
      I must admit that WinFBB has much better visual
      quality than X11 LinFBB, but probably the reasons
      for that you may find in Windows-vs.-Linux-GUI
      quality battles). FYI, my actual WinFBB is v7.00g25
      (05. January 2000) and X11 LinFBB is v7.00g (04.August
      1998).

<sect1>How to install Protus password utility

<p>
<em>Notice: Well, I have been using Protus
connection filters for a long time now. At
first, it was version 3.1/1.2 for DosFBB515c
and, later, version 3.3 for Dos/WinFBB700.
I have found Protus as very useful utility
because of its implementation of BBS-to-BBS
forwarding protection using MD2 algorythm.
One of the reasons I am going to cover Protus
in this document is a fact that its author
haven't made a manual in english yet. I keep
trying to translate the original manuals
from spanish into english, but it is a hard
process. Any good 'spanish-to-english'
translator is welcomed to contact me:
<htmlurl url="mailto:m.skoric@eunet.yu"
name="m.skoric@eunet.yu">.</em>

<p>
Protus offers several interesting features:

<p>
<itemize>

<item>It can send a presentation message to
      all users, informing about possibility
      to make users' access more safe,

<p>
<item>It can send messages to users who have
      normal access, informing about utility's
      existence,

<p>
<item>It can send messages to users who have no
      valid access (before disconnecting them),

<p>
<item>It can send messages to new users who have
      connected the BBS for the first time, informing
      them about the password utility.

<p>
<item>It can send messages to users who have entered
      wrong password (before disconnecting them),

<p>
<item>It can inform sysop about almost everything
      related to users' connections (new user on
      the system, unsuccessful connections etc),

<p>
<item>Messages mentioned above could be translated
      into various languages and used similarly as various
      language files that FBB uses,

<p>
<item>Messages mentioned above could be different
      for different BBS ports,

<p>
<item>Protus could be activated/deactivated at various 
      intervals of time using CRON.SYS system file,

<p>
<item>Passwords could be managed remotely, using an
      external server, developed by Jose EB5IVB,

<p>
<item>...

</itemize> 

<p>

Well, let's see what should be done in order to
implement secure access to the FBB packet
radio BBS, using Protus type of <em>c_filter</em>:

<p>
<itemize>

<item>Users of Dos/WinFBB versions of Protus
      already know that it is needed to create a new
      directory <bf>\FBB\PROTUS</bf> where several *.PRT
      files should be placed. In addition, the
      main C_FILT*.DLL files should be copied
      into <bf>\FBB\BIN</bf> as well as a couple of "system",
      (i.e. config) *.PRT files that are going to be
      within <bf>\FBB\SYSTEM</bf> directory.

<p>
<item>After the sysop has copied all files into
      the proper locations, it is needed to make
      some configuration. The most important files
      are two "system" ones: <tt>CONFIG.PRT</tt> and <tt>USERS.PRT</tt>
      that should be carefully adopted to any
      particular situation. Other *.PRT files will
      work as they are in original, but they might
      be translated because they are originated
      in spanish (those files are just textual
      information that are sent to users who
      connect to the BBS). For your information,
      I usualy don't care much about, because my
      BBS's are so called "open systems". It means
      they work quite normal for <em>all</em> users in the
      same way as they worked <em>before</em> implementing Protus.
      Only a couple of callsigns have password
      installed and, when connecting, they know
      what they are doing, so, they don't need
      any additional info. Your mileage may vary.

<p>
<item>So far - so good. When everything mentioned is
      done, you have to restart your FBB in order
      for Protus utility to be activated. In all
      connections to your BBS (including console),
      you should see a line like this: <bf>{PROTUS-4.0}</bf>
      just after a line [[FBB-7.00-AB1FHMRX$]. It
      only gives an information that Protus is active on the
      system. Users of your system who don't have
      their passwords, connect just normally as before.
      Users who's callsigns have password implemented,
      are prompted for password just after their connections.

<p>
<item>The author of Protus, Jesus EB5AGF, has made
      several working "modes" of its utility. It
      is possible for users to get various kinds
      of security: a fixed phrase as a password
      (similar when you connect to the Internet
      via telephone line, but this way the phrase
      can be masqueraded within the longer answer);
      a changeable answer to the 5 numbers (just
      like usual FBB sysop's password); a mode
      that uses automatic answer from user's client
      packet programs; implementation of MD2 and
      MD5 algorythms; FBB-to-FBB automatic forward
      protection etc. FYI, my WinFBB is equipped
      with 16-bit Protus 4.0 (13. August 1999).
      There is also a 32-bit module of the same date
      that would be called from within 32-bit WinFBB
      (I haven't tested those two).      

<p>
<item>Well, the situation regarding working location
      of Protus files under LinFBB is somewhat different.
      I have become familiar to the directory structure
      that DosFBB and WinFBB versions of Protus have
      been using, so I considered that it was enough
      just to copy the same directory structure when
      I started the installation of Protus under LinFBB. 
      It was wrong. After having pulled out the
      remaining hair, the things started to work, so,
      now I am going to tell you what to do.

<p>
<item>I have already told you that I have
      been running here both WinFBB under Windows NT
      and LinFBB under Linux (see also <tt>Linux+WinNT
      mini-HOWTO</tt> and <tt>Lilo mini-HOWTO</tt>). That means
      all Protus stuff has already been installed in
      a way WinFBB has required, except <em>Linux</em> 
      executable of <em>c_filter</em> file. I
      put that file into <bf>/fbb/bin</bf> directory and,
      after the next restart of LinFBB, I got the
      info mentioned above: {PROTUS-4.0}. But the
      password protection was not likely to work.
      I was told to make a new directory <bf>/var/ax25/fbb/protus</bf>
      and put *.prt files there. I <em>didn't move</em> *.PRT
      files from <bf>\FBB\PROTUS</bf> but <em>copied</em> them into
      the new location, because I wanted Protus to
      run further under WinFBB as before. The utility
      still didn't want to run, unless I copied 
      <em>also</em> *.PRT files from <bf>\FBB\SYSTEM</bf> to the
      new location (<bf>/var/ax25/fbb/protus</bf>). After I 
      did that, Protus became fully functional.

<p>
<item>Well, I suppose, the above info would be
      useful for those of you who intend to run
      *both* Windows and Linux FBB's on the same machine.
      For the majority of LinFBB-only users, it is just
      important to make <bf>/var/ax25/fbb/protus</bf> 
      where <em>all</em> *.prt files should be placed. <em>Only</em>
      c_filter executable should go to <bf>/fbb/bin</bf>
      and that's it.

<p>
<item>About FBB-to-FBB protection: *both* partners
      have to install Protus. Password for the
      forwarding partner's callsign must be the
      same at *both* sides of the link. The versions
      of Protus don't need to be the same (neither
      the versions of FBB, neither the operating
      systems, HI!). Anyway, MD5 algorythm will only
      work if both parties have Protus 4.x and
      above (I still don't use that, but it is not
      a problem, because my two boxes, DosFBB/Protus3.3 and
      WinFBB/LinFBB/Protus4.0, make all things ok with MD2).

<p>
<item>One of the interesting features of Protus is to
      log unsuccessful connections. Due to the 
      <em>different</em> locations of *.prt files here, I have
      separate logs for WinFBB and LinFBB c_filtering. 
      Those of you who are going to run only one version of
      FBB, will have <em>one</em> complete log of connection
      errors, your users make when they try
      connecting your BBS. 

<p>
<item>As it was told earlier, if you implemented
      password protection for only <em>some</em> of your
      users (but not for all of them who connect
      normally) - your system is considered as
      an "open" one. It means that will be logged
      only unsuccessful tries to enter the system
      by "protected" callsigns. But, if you decided
      that your BBS can be accessed by <em>only</em> those
      callsigns who are protected with Protus, it
      means that your system is the "closed" one. 
      Then, there is no way a user could enter your
      FBB unless its callsign has given a password
      within your Protus. Any unauthorized try to
      connect your BBS is logged. 

<p>
<item>In addition,
      you may decide to have a "guest" access or
      a "read-only" as <em>default</em> for some ports
      and/or for users who enter the wrong password.
      Many combinations are possible. You could
      even password protect your own FBB console!

<p>
<item>To finish with this topic for now, just to
      inform you that my X11 LinFBB is equipped
      with Protus v4.1b7 (15. February 2000). It
      has some minor bugs, for example, it logs
      incoming connections with a SSID of -48 if 
      a user doesn't have a SSID at all (of
      course, a SSID of -0 would be expectible
      in such case).

<p>
<sect1>How to install daemon version of LinFBB

<p>
<em>Notice: You see, folks, that I keep trying to get
as many as possible versions of this great
software (Jean-Paul, F6FBB, must be very proud after
reading these words now). What I think when mention
"as many as possible versions" means that we have
learned how to get both WinFBB and LinFBB for X11 on 
the same computer. But, that's not all. There is a
variety of daemon versions of LinFBB. In this section
we are going to discuss how to *add* a daemon LinFBB
to the existing two: X11 LinFBB and WinFBB!</em>

<p>
<itemize>

<item>Well, many amateurs suggested me to install some
      packages that looked to me as not too much needed
      for LinFBB itself - to be run. Anyway, I have installed
      those packages <em>before</em> the installation
      of LinFBB daemon version itself: 

<p>
<tscreen><verb>
      libax25.rpm
      ax25apps.rpm
      ax25tool.rpm
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
<item>Now it is the right time to install <tt>fbbsrv.rpm</tt>
      package. The archive is composed to make its
      own directories, as "base" directories. The last new
      daemon version to start with, that I managed to find as 
      a <tt>.rpm</tt> package, was 7.01f Release 4 (09. December 
      1999).

<p>
<item>A file <bf>fbb.conf</bf>, that serves as the
      replacement for <bf>init.srv</bf>, is located in the
      following location: <bf>/etc/ax25/fbb.conf</bf>

<p>
<item><em>Unless</em> you are going to install daemon-<em>only</em>
      system, you should make a backup of the
      existing following files:

<p>
<tscreen><verb>
      dirmes.sys
      etat.sys
      heard.bin
      inf.sys
      statis.dat
      tpstat.sys
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
<item>Now you have to edit <bf>/etc/ax25/fbb.conf</bf>
      and change some paths in case you already
      have X11 LinFBB installed on a <em>different</em>
      path. Here you have some examples that cover
      my particular situation...

<p>
<item>Directory of data files, instead of /var/ax25/fbb,
      should be <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/system</bf>

<p>
<item>Directory of config files, instead of /etc/ax25/fbb,
      should be <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/system</bf>

<p>
<item>Directory of message files, instead of /var/ax25/fbb/mail,
      should be <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/mail</bf>

<p>
<item>Directory of compressed files, instead of /var/ax25/fbb/binmail,
      should be <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/binmail</bf>

<p>
<item>Directory of users, instead of .../home/fbbdos/...,
      should be ...<bf>/mnt/win/fbb/users</bf>... (<-- case you 
      don't mind that both your WinFBB and LinFBB users handle 
      the same location for users' files)

<p>
<item>Directory of YAPP files, instead of /home/fbbdos/yapp,
      should be <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/users/yapp</bf> (<-- the same
      reason as above)

<p>
<item>Directory of documentation files, instead of
      /var/ax25/fbb/docs, should be <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/docs</bf>

<p>
<item>Directory of pg programs, instead of /usr/local/pg,
      should be <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/pg</bf>

<p>
<item>Path and filename for import file, instead of
      C:\FBB\MAIL.IN should be <bf>/mnt/win/fbb/mail.in</bf>

<p>
<item>Now you have to edit <bf>/usr/sbin/xfbb.sh</bf>
      and change some paths in case you already
      have running X11 version of LinFBB on a <em>different</em>
      path. Here you have an example that cover
      my particular situation...

<p>
<item>Base directory of XFBB software, instead of
      /var/ax25/fbb, should be <bf>/mnt/win/fbb</bf>

<p>
<item>So far - so good. Now it is the time to start
      LinFBB daemon. The command for that is in the
      location: <bf>/usr/sbin/xfbb.sh</bf> and it may
      be executed within an <em>xterm</em>. If
      everything is OK, you should get several
      system messages on your screen, ending with
      something like: 

<p>
<tscreen><verb>
      xfbbC/X server running ...
      xfbbd ready and running ...
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
<item>Well, daemon itself can't be used to access the
      BBS so it is needed to activate a <em>client</em>
      that is <bf>/usr/sbin/xfbbC</bf>. It has a couple
      of parameters (a callsign/password pairs that are
      stored in <bf>/fbb/passwd.sys</bf>). Note that xfbbC can
      also be activated within another <em>xterm</em>.

<p>
<item>If you are like me, you would like to activate one 
      more <em>xterm</em> with xfbbC in a way to monitor
      your radio frequency. If you have enough room on
      your screen, you may place all three <em>xterm</em> 
      windows side by side. 

<p>
<item>When you finish your xfbbC console session, it is suitable
      to use the same <em>xterm</em> to eventually stop the
      daemon. First of all, with the command <bf>ps ax</bf>
      you should locate PIDs of xfbb.sh shell and daemon itself, 
      that you may <bf>kill</bf> after that.

<sect1>How to install an "upgrade" to daemon version of LinFBB

<p>
<em>Notice: Well, the main trouble I have discovered with 7.01f 
daemon was the absence of Protus c_filter protection. As I told you
before, Protus is a "third-party" product, so it might have
some problems with the compatibility to LinFBB itself. Anyway,
it is also possible that a daemon version of LinFBB has some
special requirements over some "third-party" software.</em>

<p>
<itemize>

<item>I also noticed that my version of Protus was <em>newer</em>
      than the version of daemon LinFBB I had at first. Beside
      that, some hams, as well as F6FBB himself, have suggested me
      to upgrade LinFBB. I have also found a "problem" that I am
      still new in compiling Linux software, so, I'd rather
      look for pre-compiled packages to install easily.

<p>
<item>Jose, HI8GN, has offered daemon LinFBB v7.02g as a 
      <tt>.rpm</tt> package (18. September 2000). I got it 
      from his site:
      <url url="http://hi8gn.dynip.com/indice.html" name=
      "http://hi8gn.dynip.com/indice.html">. But, when I tried
      to install it <em>over</em> the previous version 7.01f, it
      complained about some existing LinFBB files.

<p>
<item>Then I had to de-install the old package, after what
      some config files remained as <tt>.rpmsave</tt>
      files. It was nice, so I could use them to update my
      new-installed config files.

<p>
<item>Btw, the installation of Jose's package was performed
      without problems, but the new daemon was not likely to run
      as I expected, although I tried to configure it as best 
      as I could. So, I have decided to make copies of new 
      <tt>xfbbd</tt> and <tt>xfbbC</tt> from 7.02g package and
      *de-install* the rest of its <tt>.rpm</tt>, in order to 
      install the previous version of LinFBB once again - the
      version that I was satisfied with.

<p>
<item>So far - so good. The "old" 7.01f version was installed again 
      and tested one more time to be sure it was ok. Then, I just 
      copied the previously saved executables from the new package,
      over the "old" executables. In a couple of minutes, the new 
      daemon LinFBB v7.02g has come in place and function. Comments...?

<p>
<item>Well, the new daemon is likely to check for some more directories
      than the older version (mostly regarding <tt>7plus</tt>
      operations). Next, its <tt>xfbbC</tt> console client looks better
      than the previous version. But, I still miss
      <tt>xfbbX</tt> client, that I have found not functional.
      I hope it will be fixed soon. Finally, Protus
      <tt>c_filter</tt> utility is active too.

<p>
<item>An interesting question might be: is that now a really upgraded
      LinFBB daemon or not? Actually, I haven't changed the "old" 
      script <tt>xfbbd.sh</tt> with the new one, because during the
      first tests with the new one I was getting lots of error messages.
      Looks that the directory structure was a bit complicated for me
      to set properly within the new version of <tt>xfbbd.sh</tt>.
      In addition, there are still some mysterious messages telling
      that <tt>m_filter</tt> has not been found or something like that. 
      The next tasks are to solve these issues.

<sect1>News

<p>

This is not the first release of this mini-HOWTO. I
hope to improve it whenever possible. Beside that,
there are other documents that may help you to
use amateur radio stuff on your computer. You may
look for AX.25 (mini-)HOWTO at the same location
where you get FBB mini-HOWTO.

<em>This mini-HOWTO would be improved from time 
to time. If you think that the HOWTO on your 
Linux installation CD is some out-of-date, you
may check for newest release on the Internet. It
could be found within the main <url 
url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/"
name="Linux Documentation Project">
homepage.

<sect1>HOWTO
<p>
<nidx>disk!information resources!HOWTOs</nidx>
These are intended as the primary starting points to
get the background information as well as show you how to solve
a specific problem.
Some relevant HOWTOs are <tt/Bootdisk/, <tt/Installation/,  <tt/SCSI/ and <tt/UMSDOS/.
The main site for these is the
<url url="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/"
    name="LDP archive">
at Metalab (formerly known as Sunsite).

<sect1>Mini-HOWTO
<p>
<nidx>disk!information resources!mini-HOWTOs</nidx>
These are the smaller free text relatives to the HOWTOs.
Some relevant mini-HOWTOs are
<tt/Backup-With-MSDOS/, <tt/Diskless/, <tt/LILO/, <tt/Large Disk/,
<tt/Linux+DOS+Win95+OS2/, <tt/Linux+OS2+DOS/, <tt/Linux+Win95/,
<tt/Linux+WinNT/, <tt/Linux+NT-Loader/, <tt/NFS-Root/, <tt/Win95+Win+Linux/,
<tt/ZIP Drive/, <tt/FBB packet-radio BBS/.
You can find these at the same place as the HOWTOs, usually in a sub directory
called <tt/mini/. Note that these are scheduled to be converted into SGML and
become proper HOWTOs in the near future.

<sect1>Local Resources
<p>
<nidx>disk!information resources!local</nidx>
In most distributions of Linux there is a document directory installed,
have a look in the
<htmlurl url="file:///usr/doc"
    name="/usr/doc"> directory.
where most packages store their main documentation and README files etc.
Also you will here find the HOWTO archive (
<htmlurl url="file:///usr/doc/HOWTO"
    name="/usr/doc/HOWTO">)
of ready formatted HOWTOs
and also the mini-HOWTO archive (
<url url="file:///usr/doc/HOWTO/mini"
    name="/usr/doc/HOWTO/mini">)
of plain text documents.

Many of the configuration files mentioned earlier can be found in the
<htmlurl url="file:///etc"
    name="/etc">
directory. In particular you will want to work with the
<htmlurl url="file:///etc/fstab"
    name="/etc/fstab">
file that sets up the mounting of partitions
and possibly also
<htmlurl url="file:///etc/mdtab"
    name="/etc/mdtab">
file that is used for the <tt/md/ system to set up RAID.

The kernel source in
<url url="file:///usr/src/linux"
    name="/usr/src/linux">
is, of course, the ultimate documentation. In other
words, <em>use the source, Luke</em>.
It should also be pointed out that the kernel comes not only with
source code which is even commented (well, partially at least)
but also an informative
<url url="file:///usr/src/linux/Documentation"
    name="documentation directory">.
If you are about to ask any questions about the kernel you should
read this first, it will save you and many others a lot of time
and possibly embarrassment.

Also have a look in your system log file (
<htmlurl url="file:///var/log/messages"
    name="/var/log/messages">)
to see what is going on and in particular how the booting went if
too much scrolled off your screen. Using <tt>tail -f /var/log/messages</tt>
in a separate window or screen will give you a continuous update of what is
going on in your system.

You can also take advantage of the 
<htmlurl url="file:///proc"
    name="/proc">
file system that is a window into the inner workings of your system.
Use <tt/cat/ rather than <tt/more/ to view the files as they are 
reported as being zero length. Reports are that <tt/less/ works well here.

<sect1>Web Pages
<p>
<nidx>disk!information resources!WWW</nidx>
<nidx>disk!information resources!web pages</nidx>
There is a huge number of informative web pages out there and by their very
nature they change quickly so don't be too surprised if these links become
quickly outdated.

A good starting point is of course the
<url url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/"
    name="Linux Documentation Project"> home page,
an information central for documentation, project pages and much, much more.

Please let me know if you have any other leads that can be of interest.


<sect>GETTING HELP

<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!assistance, obtaining</nidx>

In the end you might find yourself unable to solve your problems and need
help from someone else. The most efficient way is either to ask someone
local or in your nearest Linux user group, search the web for the nearest
one.

Another possibility is to ask on Usenet News in one of the many, many
newsgroups available. The problem is that these have such a high
volume and noise (called low signal-to-noise ratio) that your question
can easily fall through unanswered.

No matter where you ask it is important to ask well or you will not be
taken seriously. Saying just <it/my disk does not work/ is not going
to help you and instead the noise level is increased even further and if
you are lucky someone will ask you to clarify.

Instead describe your problems in some detail that
will enable people to help you. The problem could lie somewhere you did
not expect. Therefore you are advised to list up the following information
on your system:

<descrip>
<tag/Hardware/
<itemize>
<item>Processor
<item>DMA
<item>IRQ
<item>Chip set (LX, BX etc)
<item>Bus (ISA, VESA, PCI etc)
<item>Expansion cards used (Disk controllers, video, IO etc)
</itemize>

<tag/Software/
<itemize>
<item>BIOS (On motherboard and possibly SCSI host adapters)
<item>LILO, if used
<item>Linux kernel version as well as possible modifications and patches
<item>Kernel parameters, if any
<item>Software that shows the error (with version number or date)
</itemize>

<tag/Peripherals/
<itemize>
<item>Type of disk drives with manufacturer name, version and type
<item>Other relevant peripherals connected to the same busses
</itemize>

</descrip>

Remember that booting text is logged to <tt>/var/log/messages</tt> which can
answer most of the questions above. Obviously if the drives fail you might not
be able to get  the log saved to disk but you can at least scroll back up the
screen using the <tt/SHIFT/ and <tt/PAGE UP/ keys. It may also be useful to
include part of this in your request for help but do not go overboard, keep
it <em/brief/ as a complete log file dumped to Usenet News is more than a
little annoying.
