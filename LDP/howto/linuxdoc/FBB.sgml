This mini-HOWTO covers the installation and use of
the most popular amateur packet-radio BBS 
software FBB. That software works under Linux, DOS
and Windows operating systems. It serves as a
bulletin board system (BBS), a mailbox for
personal messages, a database for various texts,
documents and binary files, a server for small
useful calculations etc. Packet radio is a way of
connecting computers via amateur radio stations.
</abstract>

<sect>INTRODUCTION

<p>
I have been using FBB amateur radio software since
early nineties. It was the time of DOS operating
system, so most of us, system administrators (so
called system operators - sysop's) used various 
packet radio software for DOS. Versions of FBB 
packet radio BBS software for DOS, today are 
known as DosFBB. 

<p>
I still administer one DosFBB 
database in the SRV (Amateur Radio Union of 
Vojvodina, a part of SRJ). It is DosFBB v7.00g23
that runs on a 486DX computer with 16 MB of RAM
and Hercules b/w graphics. Since last December,
it runs without any re-boot (excepting some power
failures). Before that, it was a bit tricky to
set up all memory management properly, in order
to avoid "frozen" system. Although this server 
runs under DOS, its "radio clients" don't depend
on that. In fact, users of that DosFBB might run
their client software under DOS, Windows, Linux
or any other operating system that offer amateur
packet radio abilities.

<p>Two years ago, after I got my new Pentium 166
box with 32 MB of RAM and VGA color graphics, I
switched to a Windows version of FBB (so called
WinFBB). Author of the software, an radio amateur
from France, Jean-Paul F6FBB, made several
versions of WinFBB, including 16 bit and 32 bit
versions for Windows 3.x and Windows 9x and NT. 

<p>I have run both versions until now (WinFBB 
v7.00g25 under Windows NT 4.0). The main
difference between DosFBB and WinFBB is that the
second one offers you to do other jobs with your
computer while FBB runs as just one of several
applications. Beside that, it is always nice to
copy a text from another application (for example
from an Internet email) and to paste it into a
packet radio message.

<p>In the mean time, I upgraded my system to the
Celeron 400 MHz with 96 MB of RAM and a big hard
disk that has enough room to try Linux...

<sect>INSTALLATION

<p>
<sect1>How to install X11 version of LinFBB

<p>
<itemize>

<item>First of all, you should have running Linux
      with a GUI installed. I am fully satisfied
      with Gnome GUI but I suppose that KDE will
      be ok too (or any other GUI available).

<p>
<item>Download or copy LinFBB (the main ftp site
      is ftp.f6fbb.org but there are many mirror
      sites too). For example, if you get a file
      like x700e_full.tgz it means that it is X11
      version 7.00e and it contains all you need
      in tgz archive to install the BBS. On the
      other hand, name like xd700g_full.tgz means
      that it is not X11 but daemon version 7.00g
      and it is also complete to unpack. Further,
      x700f01.tgz and x700g.tgz are "upgrades" to
      any previous "full" package.

<p>
<item>Copy the archive file in /tmp directory.

<p>
<item>You have to make a "base" directory where
      your FBB will be installed. For example you
      may type: mkdir /usr/local/fbb if you want
      FBB to be there. You have to be logged as
      'root' or 'superuser' to install FBB.

<p>
<item>Then, you should locate yourself in that
      directory: cd /usr/local/fbb.

<p>
<item>Now, you should unpack the archive:
      tar xvzf /tmp/x700b25.tgz (<-- use the right
      name of the archive here).

<p>
<item>When you finished unpacking the archive,
      you may continue installing the software:
      ./install.sh is the command for that. The
      setup will ask you for the 'base' directory
      where FBB will be installed. If you chose
      /usr/local/fbb again, you will be told that
      such directory already exists and all files
      will be overwritten. It is ok, so you should
      answer yes. If everything is ok, you should
      see on the screen that fbb system 
      directories are created. At the beginning
      of that procedure, program will ask you for
      bbs's callsign, name of the city, QTH 
      locator, your name etc. That details will
      become a part of /usr/local/fbb/init.srv
      file. 

<p>
<item>Beside that, you MUST check this file
      again manualy and fix other details if
      needed (because installation script does
      not fix all parts of init.srv).

<p>
<item>Well, so far - so good. After you checked
      all configuration files, you may start the
      software: ./xfbb.sh (<-- type this within
      an xterm or something similar). When you
      start FBB for the first time, it will ask
      you to create some files it needs, so you
      should answer yes to the questions.

</itemize>

<p>
<sect1>How to install LinFBB beside WinFBB

<p>
<em>Notice: Folks, you see, at my place, I have a
dual-boot system, consisting of Windows NT and
Linux (each of them having their own partition(s)
and file system). I wanted to have 'independent'
operating systems that won't see each other. So I
made two NT's partitions as NTFS partitions and
rest of the space used Linux as ext2 partitions.
Well, first I have installed WinFBB under NT and
LinFBB under Linux. Both of them worked, but there
was a big "problem": I could not share their
system files. You might say: So, what a big deal.
But, my FBB's should serve as packet forwarding 
stations, so it would be very useful for LinFBB 
to know the point where WinFBB stopped the mail 
exchange last time (and vice versa). </em>
 
<p>
<itemize>

<item>Well, in order to allow both WinFBB under
      Windows NT and LinFBB under Linux to use
      some common files, it is needed to put these
      files in a place both operating systems can
      "see" them. So I do that by re-installing
      WinFBB onto a FAT (FAT16) partition that is
      seen by NT and Linux. The best way to do 
      that is to install a fresh copy of WinFBB on
      a FAT partition and to copy complete old 
      WinFBB from NTFS partition over the fresh 
      installation (whenever you are asked to 
      rewrite existing files, you should answer
      yes).

<p>
<item>When it is finished, you should have a clone
      of the existing old WinFBB, but this time on
      the FAT partition that is visible from under
      Linux. Anyway, you should check if 
      everything is running ok like before.

<p>
<item>It is also recommended to check the file
      tree of WinFBB in order to become more
      familiar with that. The file tree of LinFBB
      is a bit different so it is advisable to
      note those details.

<p>
<item>Some files can't be used as such under both
      operating systems (without some neccesary
      changes). That's why some file names should
      be renamed:

<p>
      init.srv    ->  init_w.srv
      forward.sys ->  forw_w.sys
      port.sys    ->  port_w.sys
      protect.sys ->  prot_w.sys

<p>
      FBB is able to recognize those changes.

<p>
<item>Make a backup of the new WinFBB (I make this
      by copying the whole file structure into
      another Windows partition that won't be
      shared with Linux, like NTFS one).

<p>
<item>Now you should restart your machine and boot
      Linux. Log on as 'root' or make 'su' from a
      user's account.

<p>
<item>Mount a shared FAT directory:
      mount vfat /dev/hda2 /mnt/win

<p>
<item>Copy LinFBB archive to /tmp directory.

<p>
<item>Locate yourself to a 'base' directory:
      cd /usr/local/fbb (for example).

<p>
<item>Unpack the archive: tar xvzf /tmp/filename.

<p>
<item>Start the installation script ./install.sh
      and, after asked for the 'base' installation
      directory, chose /usr/local/fbb. Doesn't
      matter if the program warns you that such
      directory already exists so existing files
      will be overwritten (by the way, if you
      choose a mounted directory shared with NT,
      many original WinFBB files would be over-
      written by LinFBB files, so after returning 
      to Windows, WinFBB might not be functional
      like before).

<p>
<item>Copy /usr/local/fbb to /mnt/win/fbb but do
      not over-write existing files with files 
      with same names.

<p>
<item>Copy /mnt/win/fbb/init_w.srv to a file
      /mnt/win/fbb/init_l.srv 

<p>
<item>Edit /mnt/win/fbb/init_l.srv to what is
      needed for Linux. You may use the existing
      file /mnt/win/fbb/init.srv as an example.

<p>
<item>Copy newly edited /mnt/win/fbb/init_l.srv
      over the /mnt/win/fbb/init.srv (if you do
      not do that, maybe you can't start LinFBB
      using ./xfbb.sh , like me).

<p>
<item>Copy /mnt/win/fbb/system/port_w.sys to
      /mnt/win/fbb/system/port_l.sys file.

<p>
<item>Edit /mnt/win/fbb/system/port_l.sys to
      what is needed for Linux. You may use the
      existing file /mnt/win/fbb/system/port.sys
      as an example.

<p>
<item>Edit /mnt/win/fbb/xfbb.sh in order to fix
      the right path.

<p>
<item>Start the script ./xfbb.sh to run LinFBB.
      If everything is ok, LinFBB under Linux
      should run with the same parameters as
      WinFBB do under Windows.
