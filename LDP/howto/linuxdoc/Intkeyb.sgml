<abstract>
How to setup international keyboard in Linux or Unix. This xmodmap 
and kimap solutions will work for you in setting up any international 
keyboard for (Debian, RedHat, Mandrake, CorelLinux) Linux, FreeBSD, 
OpenBSD, NetBSD and possibly every Unix that uses Xfree86 and KDE. 
The advantage of this howto is that it is not architecture specific 
and will work on SPARK, MIPS and all other systems. However, it is
a little experimental in that that it bypasses some standardized
international country-specific keyboard solutions.

The international keyboard HOWTO. Copyright (C) 1999, 2001 Juraj Sipos 
(xvudpapc@savba.sk). Imagine you use Linux or a BSD OS and want to write 
a business letter to a person that has a foreign name with a slash or 
idiaresis. Danish language uses signs like &#248; and Spanish like &#241;.

<p> 
With this information you can make your own international keyboard
layout without installing any additional packages. The following
information will help you set up German, Spanish, Italian, Slovak,
Czech, Polish, Slovenian, Croatian, Danish, Dutch, French, Finnish,
Norwegian, Estonian, Latvian, Swedish and other keyboards without
additional installing of national packages. You can also alternatively 
look at my homage at <htmlurl url="http://freebsd.nfo.sk/" 
name="http://freebsd.nfo.sk"> to see layouts of various keyboards. 
In case you want to install Greek, Hebrew or Russian language, 
follow my information and apply changes pertinent to these 
languages (e.g., to install Greek fonts, etc.).
 
<sect>Setting up international keyboard in X Windows
<p>
The biggest problem with kikbd or international keyboard under KDE in
X Windows is that it doesn't work in Xfree86 that easily (you have
to install some national packages and write garbage to the 
above-mentioned files). A user expects a simple way for 
configuring his or her keyboard for international settings. A simple
way is to start KDE, change the international keyboard settings and
immediately write in the language we chose (this will work for German
and other languages, but in Eastern European keyboards some letters
may not function in a system specific environment). According to the 
KDE documentation it should work, but it doesn't. After exploring many 
KDE resources on the net some time ago, I didn't find a solution 
(except for the one that forces you to install some national package). 
I know that some locale settings should be included in my bash_profile 
or csh login scripts, but after applying these settings I couldn't change 
(and install) keyboards in FreeBSD and it appeared like going through 
a darker forest compared to the information I already had
regarding localization of KDE and X Windows under Xfree86. Here are
some solutions for installing international keyboard layouts.  
If you want to write the "garbage", try to put the following in your
FreeBSD or BSD bash_profile (or even Linux, but certainly not RedHat;
RedHad Linux has very good international customization and my Czech 
RedHat does not require manipulation of bash_profile file at all):
<p>
LC_ALL=slovak (or any other language)
<p>
LANG=slovak   (or any other language)
<p>
This is enough. Just continue reading.

<p>
<sect1>Use of this information may be system-specific

<p>
The following information will help you set up any European keyboard layout
(good for some older systems if the LC_ALL=language etc. doesn't work. 
However, this LC_ALL=language solution works in FreeBSD 4.1, but you 
must have ISO8859-2 fonts installed).

<p>
The next solution works for Xfree86 in FreeBSD 3.1 RELEASE (.Xmodmap 
solution), Corel Linux, Debian Linux, RedHat and FreeBSD 3.3 RELEASE 
and 4.0 RELEASE (KDE *.kimap solution). This solution maybe also useful when 
you use on older computer and older system, as some newer systems refuse 
to run on a 386 or 486 processor computer with less RAM. I tested it 
on those systems. Note: .Xmodmap solution works well with other 
windows managers. 

<p>
Some Unixes override .Xmodmap setting when used with KDE. If .Xmodmap doesn't 
work, change must be made to the KDE kimap files in ../kikbd directory. 
This also pertains to LC_ALL=language; LANG=language solution.
If .Xmodmap solution doesn't work in KDE, copy skz.kimap (at the end
of this article) to /usr/local/share/apps/kikbd (FreeBSD), or to
/usr/share/apps/kikbd directory (RedHat),  which is your KDE
keyboard directory. The problem with KDE is that after installing another
keyboard, you have no chance to use (at least in older versions) 
it as KDE documentation doesn't clearly state how to define your 
locale settings in a bash_profile. After I installed Slovak keyboard 
in KDE, I couldn't write in Slovak or Czech, so I made few changes 
to skz.kimap file, which are explained later in this file. After
applying these changes, no other changes are necessary - you don't
need to write any special commands to your bash_profile or XF86Config. 
<bf>BUT WHEN YOU INSTALL ANOTHER KEYBOARD in START/SETTINGS/INPUT
DEVICES/INTERNATIONAL KEYBOARDS</bf> from your KDE menu, CHECK AUTOSTART.
Then everything will work fine. The difference between skz.kimap and
sky.kimap (and csz.kimap and csy.kimap) is that y,Y and z,Z are swapped,
so with skz.kimap or csz.kimap you will have z,Z instead of y,Y, but
with sky.kimap or csy.kimap, y,Y doesn't change its position on the
IBM English keyboard layout.  

<p>
<sect1>How to do it

<p>
!!!BEAR IN MIND. THE FOLLOWING IS NOT NECESSARY IF YOUR LOCALIZATION WORKS
BY PUTTING
<p> 
LC_ALL=language
<p>
LANG=language
<p>
in your bash_profile. However, you must install the pertinent language
fonts and put path in XF86Config file to these fonts. 

<p>
a) Copy the "Compose"
 file from /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-2
to: /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-1 directory (yes, iso8859-1,
not iso8859-2). Back up the original "Compose" file if you want 
(alternatively, copy other iso885*** Compose file to iso8859-1 
directory). 

<p>
b) Put the included .Xmodmap file to your root directory (Slovak
language, or make your own .Xmodmap file) (or possibly put your 
own *.kimap file to the kikbd directory if Xmodmap  will not work) 

<p>
c) Install ISO8859-2 fonts (or other pertinent fonts). 

<p>
d) Disable every "Scroll lock" uncommented line in your XF86Config, 
because our .Xmodmap uses scroll lock to switch between keyboards. 

<p>
e) Put the appropriate fontpath for your newly installed fonts 
in our XF86Config file, if necessary. The .Xmodmap solution may be 
applied to all X keyboards; .Xmodmap file overrides all settings 
of keyboard layouts as defined in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb/symbols/, 
where are symbols for many international keyboards. The .Xmodmap 
solution will give you an enhanced Slovak typewriter keyboard 
layout. First, I must say that in my solution, different mapping 
is used for .Xmodmap file (and kimap file) for some ISO definitions. 
This means that the ISO definitions will either give you what 
they say they are (aacute [&#225;], eacute [&#233;], etc.), or they 
will not give you what they say they are (putting "threequarters" in 
your .Xmodmap file will give not give you "3/4" but "z" with a caron 
above it). For example, "mu" will give lcaron, "oslash" rcaron, 
etc. (Obviously, in other case you need to install some national
packages to use "lcaron" definition instead of "mu"). Normally, you 
can not put "lcaron" to the .Xmodmap file, because it will not give 
you lcaron; you must write "mu" instead, or "guillemotright"
for tcaron (again, you may avoid this if the "LANG=language" solution
in your bash_profile works). I also tried hexadecimal numbers and they work. 

<p>
However, other key definitions, for example, adieresis (a with two 
dots above it), uacute (u with slash above it), as well as dead_diaeresis 
do not require a substitution of other definitions and work pretty well 
as they're defined everywhere (dead key is a key when you press it, hold 
it yet nothing happens, but after pressing another key you will get 
a special letter).

<p>
The original "Compose" file in ../iso8859-1 directory can be fully
utilized for Slovak or Czech keyboard layouts (Polish, Hungarian, Slovenian,
Croatian), but there is only one problem with the Slovak or Czech keyboard
(and other languages too) layout - dead_caron doesn't work. That's why you
have to copy the "Compose" file from the iso8859-2 directory to iso8859-1
directory, or alternatively, you can edit the "Compose" file in iso8859-1
directory and put all references about "dead_caron" from iso8859-2/Compose
to iso8859-1/Compose file. You can leave the Keyboard section in your
XF86Config without much change. Put (if it's not already there) the
following in the "Keyboard" section: 
Section "Keyboard" 
<p>
Protocol "Standard"
<p>
XkbRules "xfree86" 
<p>
XkbModel "pc101" 
<p>
XkbLayout "us" 

<p>
The above doesn't have to be changed if 
<p>
LC_ALL=language
<p>
LANG=language
<p>
solution works. The LC_ALL=language solution treats the dead_caron or any
dead key well.

<p>
Some X Windows managers and/or environments override .Xmodmap settings, 
so if you use KDE and .Xmodmap doesn't work, use kikbd keymap instead 
of .Xmodmap. (A sample kikbd kimap for the Slovak language is included 
at the bottom of this file). The Slovak/Czech/English keyboard layout 
is switched to by a scroll lock. You may use languages only with the
applications that have access to your ISO-8859-2 (or other fonts) fonts
(this may not work with StarOffice or with other applications that
have their own built-in fonts). StarOffice has its own fonts directory 
for afm fonts in ../xp3/fontmetrics/afm, and ps fonts in../xp3/pssoftfonts,
so you must add the ISO8859-2 fonts directory to these directories
(to tell StarOffice to use these fonts too) and edit fonts.dir file
and add the symlinked fonts there. I can easily write with any language in
StarOffice. Important note: If you want to exchange documents 
between StarOffice 5.1 or WordPerfect and MS Word, you must include 
the information about the windows 1250 encoding to the file you write
(win1250 is similar to iso8859-2, but it's a little bit different).
This doesn't need to be done if you use StarOffice 5.2, but for the
older versions, you must use a converter from iso8859-2 to win1250.  
You can find one at my home page at htmlurl 
url="http://www.home.sk/www/man/bsd1.htm" 
name="http//www.home.sk/www/man/bsd1.htm" or at 
htmlurl url="http://freebsd.nfo.sk" name="http://www.freebsd.nfo.sk". 


<sect1>Xmodmap theory

<p>
If you want to edit and make your own .Xmodmap keyboard layout definitions, 
I'll explain one line of the .Xmodmap file to make clear what you should do. 

<p>
This explanation can be used for all keycodes. For example, the line: 
keycode 0x11 = 8 asterisk aacute 8 
(note: keycode 0x11 is derived from xkeycaps utility; you can also use
the X Windows "xev" utility to play more with keyboard puzzles) 
says that the first pair, the default one, (number "8" and "asterisk")
will display number "8" when you press keycode 0x11 ("8"), will display
asterisk when a "shift" key is pressed. After pressing the scroll lock,
there's another definition: ISO_NEXT_GROUP, which means that when you
press the default "8" key, no "8" will be displayed, but aacute ("&#225;");
when you press the "shift" key, number "8" will be displayed. So if
you change "aacute" and "8", anything you put instead of "aacute" and
"8" will be displayed, for example: 
<p>
keycode 0x11 = 8 asterisk semicolon colon 
<p>
will give you "semicolon" and "colon" in your 0x11 keycode after
pressing  the scroll lock. If you delete the ISO_NEXT_GROUP (the next 
pair of definitions on the right), you will have only one group of keyboard
definitions ("8" and "asterisk"). Be careful when editing the .Xmodmap
file. You mustn't delete definitions that enable utilization of the
scroll lock unless you know what you are doing. These are the lines
such as: keycode 0x4e = ISO_Next_Group add mod5 = ISO_Next_Group etc.
You must also keep in mind that Unixes are case sensitive. If you
want to find out more about keycodes, install the package "xkeycaps" or
use "xev".

Now follows the KDE skz.kimap Config File, modified by me.
You may manipulate this file according to my information and 
name it as skz.kimap and copy it to KDE ../kikbd directory mentioned above. 
If you want to use your own experimental keyboard layout, manipulate an

<sect1>Character sets

<p>
The purpose of the following info is to help you build any .Xmodmap
or kimap keyboard layout with iso8859-2 or other character sets.  
The ISO-8859-2 Character Set file is included here for you to know
which names are used for pertinent keys. You should not bother about
the numbers, but notice how keys are named. Much of this information is
usefull to build a keyboard with ISO-8859-1 characters only, or a 
combination of Eastern European characters and Western characters.
If you're going to use other languages than the Central European ones, 
find a pertinent table for your ISO*** character set on Internet. 
The gdkkeysyms.h file is in (RedHat) /usr/include/gdk/gdkkeysyms.h 
and it contains all the special names we're using here (it also 
contains names of Greek characters).

First, try to see if definitions will give you (after installing
pertinent fonts and keyboard in X) what they say they are. If they will
not give you what they say they are (some keycodes will be unfunctional),
then you must make a substitution. Definitions which will not give you
what they say they are (when the LC_ALL=language solution does not work) can 
be traced by their visual shape in Western Latin 1 encoding. For example, 
if you load a Slovak website, do not use ISO8859-2 character set encoding 
for viewing, but Western ISO8859-1 encoding for viewing. Thus you will see 
bad fonts with letters like micron and so on. You will see what you must 
substitute. But if you don't know what "?" is called in ISO terminology, 
find and download an appropriate character set table for ISO-8859-1. 
(However, much of the information can be used from the above ISO8859-2
Character Set Table.) It must be somewhere on the net. 

<p>
The following symbols on your right is what I found out through my research.
This is just an example. When you use a "Pound" definition in Xmodmap 
or kimap file, the X Windows will display you a Lslash instead (in relation
to using iso8859-2 fonts of course). When you choose some easy KDE Text 
Editor, select iso8859-2 fonts. NOTE: vowel *acute signs require no 
substitution, therefore  I omitted iacute, aacute etc.  
<p>
0243 0xa3 /Lslash      "Pound" in Xmodmap or kimap file will give you Lslash.
<p>
0245 0xa5 /Lcaron      Writing "yen" to kimap or Xmodmap file wil give us Lcaron 
<p>
0251 0xa9 /Scaron      copyright (will give us Scaron) 
<p>
0253 0xab /Tcaron      guillemotleft (will give us Tcaron)

You may experiment to find out which definitions will give you which
characters, it shouldn't be difficult. This is just a hint on how to
start. I didn't go on to investigate further definitions because I have
my Slovak and Czech keyboards and I'm not, for now, interested to use
other keyboards.  Look at my homage and build your own keyboard.
