<sect>Introduction

<p>
This is the Chroot-BIND HOWTO; see <ref id="where" Name="Where?"> for the master
site, which contains the latest copy.  It is assumed that you already know how
to configure and use BIND (the Berkeley Internet Name Domain).  If not, I would
recommend that you read the DNS HOWTO first.  It is also assumed that you have
a basic familiarity with compiling and installing software on your UNIX-like
system.

<sect1>What?

<p>
This document describes some extra security precautions that you can take when
you install BIND.  It explains how to configure BIND so that it resides in a
``chroot jail'', meaning that it cannot see or access files outside its own
little directory tree.  We shall also configure it to run as a non-root user.

The idea behind chroot is fairly simple.  When you run BIND (or any other
process) in a chroot jail, the process is simply unable to see any part of the
filesystem outside the jail.  For example, in this document, we'll set BIND up
to run chrooted to the directory <tt>/chroot/named</>.  Well, to BIND, the
contents of this directory will appear to be <tt>/</>, the root directory.
Nothing outside this directory will be accessible to it.  You've probably
encounted a chroot jail before, if you've ever ftped into a public system.

<sect1>Why?

<p>
The idea behind running BIND in a chroot jail is to limit the amount of access
any malicious individual could gain by exploiting vulnerabilities in BIND.  It
is for the same reason that we run BIND as a non-root user.

This should be considered as a supplement to the normal security precautions
(running the latest version, using access control, etc.), not a replacement for
them.

If you're interested in DNS security, you might also be interested in a few
other products.  Building BIND with <url
url="http://www.immunix.org/products.html#stackguard" name="StackGuard"> would
probably be a good idea for even more protection.  Using it is easy; it's
just like using ordinary gcc.  Also, <url
url="http://cr.yp.to/dnscache.html" name="DNScache"> is a secure replacement
for BIND, written by Dan Bernstein.  Dan is the author of qmail, and DNScache
appears to follow a similar philosophy.

<sect1>Where?<label id="where">

<p>
The latest version of this document is always available from the web site of the
Linux/Open Source Users of Regina, Sask., at <url
url="http://www.losurs.org/docs/howto/Chroot-BIND.html">.

BIND is available from <url url="http://www.isc.org/" name="the Internet
Software Consortium"> at <url url="http://www.isc.org/bind.html">.  As of this
writing, the current version of BIND is 8.2.2_P5.

<sect1>How?

<p>
I wrote this document based on my experiences in setting BIND up in a chroot
environment.  In my case, I already had an existing BIND installation in the
form of a package that came with my Linux distribution.  I'll assume that most
of you are probably in the same situation, and will simply be transferring over
and modifying the configuration files from your existing BIND installation, and
then removing the package before installing the new one.  Don't remove the
package yet, though; we may want some files from it first.

If this is not the case for you, you should still be able to follow this
document.  The only difference is that, where I refer to copying an existing
file, you first have to create it yourself.  The DNS HOWTO may be helpful for
this.

<sect1>Disclaimer

<p>
These steps worked for me, on my system.  Your mileage may vary.  This is but
one way to approach this; there are other ways to set the same thing up
(although the general approach will be the same).  It just happens that this
was the first way that I tried that worked, so I wrote it down.

My BIND experience to date has been installing on Linux servers.  However, most
of the instructions in this document should be easily applicable to other
flavours of UNIX as well, and I shall try to point out differences of which I am
aware.

<sect>Preparing the Jail

<sect1>Creating a User

<p>
As mentioned in the introduction, it's not a good idea to run BIND as root.  So,
before we begin, let's create a separate user for BIND.  Note that you should
never use an existing user like <tt>nobody</> for this purpose.

This requires adding a line something like the following to <tt>/etc/passwd</>:
<tscreen><verb>
named:x:200:200:Nameserver:/chroot/named:/bin/false
</verb></tscreen>
And one like this to <tt>/etc/group</>:
<tscreen><verb>
named:x:200:
</verb></tscreen>
This creates a user and group called <tt>named</> for BIND.  Make sure that the
UID and GID (both 200 in this example) are unique on your system.  The shell is
set to <tt>/bin/false</> because this user will never need to log in.

<sect1>Directory Structure

<p>
Now, we must set up the directory structure that we will use for the chroot jail
in which BIND will live.  This can be anywhere on your filesystem; the truly
paranoid may even want to put it on a separate volume.  I shall assume that you
will use <tt>/chroot/named</>.  Let's start by creating the following directory
structure:

<tscreen><verb>
/chroot
  +-- named
       +-- bin
       +-- dev
       +-- etc
       |    +-- namedb
       +-- lib
       +-- var
            +-- run
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Placing the BIND Data

<p>
Assuming that you have already done a conventional installation of BIND and are
using it, you will already have an existing <tt>named.conf</> and zone files.
These files must now be moved (or copied, to be safe) into the chroot jail, so
that BIND can get at them.  <tt>named.conf</> goes in <tt>/chroot/named/etc</>,
and the zone files can go in <tt>/chroot/named/etc/namedb</>.  For example:
<tscreen><verb>
# cp -p /etc/named.conf /chroot/named/etc/

# cp -a /var/named/* /chroot/named/etc/namedb/
</verb></tscreen>

BIND will likely need to write to the <tt>namedb</> directory, and probably some
of the files in it.  For example, if your DNS serves as a slave for a zone, it
will have to update that zone file.  Also, BIND can dump statistical
information, and does so in this directory.  For that reason, you should
probably make the <tt>named</> user the owner of this directory and its contents:
<tscreen><verb>
# chown -R named:named /chroot/named/etc/namedb
</verb></tscreen>
BIND will also need to write to the <tt>/var/run</> directory, to put its
pidfile and ndc socket there, so let's allow it to do so:
<tscreen><verb>
# chown named:named /chroot/named/var/run
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>System Support Files

<p>
Once BIND is running in the chroot jail, it will not be able to access files
outside the jail <bf>at all</>.  However, it needs to access a few key files, such
as the system's C library.  Exactly what libraries are required will depend on
your flavour of UNIX.  For most modern Linux systems, the following commands
will be sufficient to put the necessary libraries in place:
<tscreen><verb>
# cd /chroot/named/lib
# cp -p /lib/libc-2.*.so .
# ln -s libc-2.*.so libc.so.6
# cp -p /lib/ld-2.*.so .
# ln -s ld-2.*.so ld-linux.so.2
</verb></tscreen>
As an alternative, you could simply build statically-linked versions of the BIND
binaries to put in your chroot jail.  You should also copy <tt>ldconfig</> into
the jail, and run it to create an <tt>etc/ld.so.conf</> for the jail environment.
The following commands could take care of this:
<tscreen><verb>
# cp /sbin/ldconfig /chroot/named/bin/
# chroot /chroot/named /bin/ldconfig -v
</verb></tscreen>

BIND needs one more system file in its jail:  good ol' <tt>/dev/null</>.  Again,
the exact command necessary to create this device node may vary from system to
system; check your <tt>/dev/MAKEDEV</> script to be sure.  Some systems may also
require <tt>/dev/zero</>.  For most Linux systems, we can use the following
command:
<tscreen><verb>
# mknod /chroot/named/dev/null c 1 3
</verb></tscreen>

Finally, you need a couple extra files in the <tt>/etc</> directory inside the
jail.  In particular, you must copy <tt>/etc/localtime</> (this sometimes known
as <tt>/usr/lib/zoneinfo/localtime</> on some systems) in there so that BIND
logs things with the right time on them, and you must make a simple <tt/group/
file with the <tt/named/ group in it.  The following two commands will take care
of this:
<tscreen><verb>
# cp /etc/localtime /chroot/named/etc/

# echo 'named:x:200:' > /chroot/named/etc/group
</verb></tscreen>

Keep in mind that the GID, 200 in this example, must match the one you defined
in the real <tt>/etc/group</> above.

<sect1>Logging<label id="logging">

<p>
Unlike a conventional jailbird, BIND can't just scribble its log entries on the
walls :-).  Normally, BIND logs through <tt/syslogd/, the system logging daemon.
However, this type of logging is performed by sending the log entries to the
special socket <tt>/dev/log</>.  Since this is outside the jail, BIND can't use
it any more.  Fortuantely, there are a couple options to work around this.

<sect2>The Ideal Solution

<p>
The ideal solution to this dilemma requires a reasonably recent version of
<tt/syslogd/ which supports the <tt/-a/ switch introduced by OpenBSD.  Check the
manpage for your <tt/syslogd(8)/ to see if you have such a version.

If you do, all you have to do is add the switch ``<tt>-a
/chroot/named/dev/log</>'' to the command line when you launch <tt/syslogd/.  On
systems which use a full SysV-init (which includes most Linux distributions),
this is typically done in the file <tt>/etc/rc.d/init.d/syslog</>.  For example,
on my Red Hat Linux system, I changed the line
<tscreen><verb>
daemon syslogd -m 0
</verb></tscreen>
to
<tscreen><verb>
daemon syslogd -m 0 -a /chroot/named/dev/log
</verb></tscreen>
The simply restart <tt/syslogd/, either by killing it and launching it again, or
by using the SysV-init script to do it for you:
<tscreen><verb>
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/syslog stop
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/syslog start
</verb></tscreen>

Once it's been restarted, you should see a ``file'' in <tt>/chroot/named/dev</>
called <tt/log/, that looks something like this:

<verb>srw-rw-rw-   1 root     root            0 Mar 13 20:58 log</verb>

<sect2>The Other Solutions

<p>
If you have an older <tt/syslogd/, then you'll have to find another way to do
your logging.  There are a couple programs out there, such as <tt/holelogd/,
which are designed to help by acting as a ``proxy'' and accepting log entries
from the chrooted BIND and passing them out to the regular <tt>/dev/log</>
socket.

Alteratively, you can simply configure BIND to log to files instead of going
through syslog.  See the BIND documentation for more details if you choose to go
this route.

<sect>Compiling BIND

<p>
You should be able to find the BIND source by visiting <url
url="http://www.isc.org/bind.html">.  You need the <tt/bind-src.tar.gz/ package.
Be sure to get the latest version!

<sect1>Modifying Paths

<p>
Things can get a bit confusing at this point, because different parts of the
BIND package will be referring to the same directories by different names
(depending on whether or not they're running inside the jail).  I'll try not to
confuse you <bf/too/ much :-).

The main directory that we have to worry about here is <tt>/var/run</>, because
its contents are required for both the main <tt/named/ daemon (inside the jail),
and the <tt/ndc/ utility (on the outside).  We'll start by setting everything up
to find this directory from the outside world.  To do this, we need to modify
<tt>src/port/linux/Makefile.set</> (substitute your port's directory if you're
not running Linux), and change the line
<tscreen><verb>
DESTRUN=/var/run
</verb></tscreen>
to
<tscreen><verb>
DESTRUN=/chroot/named/var/run
</verb></tscreen>
While you're in there, you may want to change the other destination paths from
<tt>/usr</> to <tt>/usr/local</>.

Now everything should be able to find that directory... except the <tt/named/
daemon itself, to which it's still just <tt>/var/run</> inside the jail.  We can
get around this by making a small change in the <tt/named/ source.  In the file
<tt>src/bin/named/named.h</>, find the line
<tscreen><verb>
#include "pathnames.h"
</verb></tscreen>
and add the following line immediately after it
<tscreen><verb>
#define _PATH_NDCSOCK    "/var/run/ndc"
</verb></tscreen>
This way, <tt/named/ will ignore our definition of <tt/DESTRUN/ over in
<tt/Makefile.set/ and use the correct location (from its perspective in the
chroot jail).  You will notice some warnings about redefinitions of
_PATH_NDCSOCK when you do the build; just ignore them.

<sect1>Doing the Build

<p>
You should now be able to compile BIND as normal, following the instructions in
the <tt/INSTALL/ file.  At this stage, we only want to compile BIND, not install
it.  Don't go too far when following the <tt/INSTALL/ file.  Essentially, it's
just <tt/make clean/, <tt/make depend/, and <tt/make/.

<sect>Installing Your Shiny New BIND

<p>
I should mention that if you have an existing installation of BIND, such as from
an RPM, you should probably remove it before installing the new one.  On Red Hat
systems, this probably means removing the packages <tt/bind/ and
<tt/bind-utils/, and possibly <tt/bind-devel/ and <tt/caching-nameserver/, if
you have them.

You may want to save a copy of the init script (e.g.,
<tt>/etc/rc.d/init.d/named</>), if any, before doing so; it'll be useful later
on.

<sect1>Installing the Tools Outside the Jail

<p>
This is the easy part :-).  Just run <tt/make install/ and let it take care of
it for you.  You may want to <tt>chmod 000 /usr/local/sbin/named</> afterwards,
to make sure you don't accidentally run the non-chrooted copy of BIND.  (This
is <tt>/usr/sbin/named</> if you didn't tell it to go in <tt>/usr/local/sbin</>
like I suggested.)

<sect1>Installing the Binaries in the Jail

<p>
Only two parts of the package have to live inside the chroot jail:  the main
<tt/named/ daemon itself, and <tt/named-xfer/, which it uses for zone transfers.
You can simply copy them in from the source tree:
<tscreen><verb>
# cp src/bin/named/named /chroot/named/bin

# cp src/bin/named-xfer/named-xfer /chroot/named/bin
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Setting up the Init Script

<p>
If you have an existing init script from your distribution, it would probably be
best simply to modify it to run <tt>/chroot/named/bin/named</>, with the
appropriate switches.  The switches are... <it/(drumroll please...)/
<itemize>
<item><tt/-u named/, which tells BIND to run as the user <tt/named/, rather than
<tt/root/.
<item><tt/-g named/, to run BIND under the group <tt/named/ too, rather than
<tt/root/ or <tt/wheel/.
<item><tt>-t /chroot/named</>, which tells BIND to chroot itself to the jail
that we've set up.
</itemize>

The following is the init script I use with my Red Hat 6.0 system.  As you can
see, it is almost exactly the same as the way it shipped from Red Hat.  I have
also modified the <tt>ndc restart</> command so that it restarts the server
properly, and keeps it chrooted.  You should probably do the same in your init
script, even if you don't copy this one.

</code></tscreen>

<sect1>Configuration Changes

<p>
You will also have to add or change a few options in your <tt/named.conf/ to
keep the various directories straight.  In particular, you should add (or
change, if you already have them) the following directives in the <tt/options/
section:
<tscreen><code>
directory "/etc/namedb";
pid-file "/var/run/named.pid";
named-xfer "/bin/named-xfer";
</code></tscreen>
Since this file is being read by the <tt/named/ daemon, all the paths are of
course relative to the chroot jail.

<sect>The End

<sect1>Launching BIND

<p>
Everything should be set up, and you should be ready to put your new, more
secure BIND into action.  Assuming you set up a SysV-style init script, you can
simply launch it as:
<tscreen><verb>
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/named start
</verb></tscreen>
Make sure you kill any old versions of BIND still running before doing this.

If you take a look at your logs, you should find the initialisation messages
that BIND spits out when it loads.  (If not, there's a problem with your <ref
id="logging" name="logging configuration"> that you need to fix.)  Amongst those
messages, BIND should tell you that it chrooted successfully, and that it is
running as the user and group <tt/named/.  If not, you have a problem.

<sect1>That's It!

<p>
You can go take a nap now ;-).
