 This document describes how to enable file system quota on a Linux host,
 assigning quota for users and groups, as well as the usage of miscellaneous
 quota commands. It is intended for users running kernel 2.x (recently tested
 on RedHat 4.1 running kernel 2.0.27). Users running older kernels may need
 to upgrade to a newer kernel version in order to take advantage of quota.

<sect>What is Quota?
<p>

Quota allows you to specify limits on two aspects of disk storage: the
 number of inodes a user or a group of users may possess; and the number of
 disk blocks that may be allocated to a user or a group of users.

The idea behind quota is that users are forced to stay under their disk
 comsumption limit, taking away their ability to comsume unlimited disk space
 on a system. Quota is handled on a per user, per file system basis. If there
 is more than one file system which a user is expected to create files, then
 quota must be set for each file system seperately.
<sect>Current Status of Quota on Linux
<p>

Quota support has been integrated into kernel since version 1.3.8x I heard.
 Now it is part of the 2.0 release of the Linux kernel. If your system doesn't
 support quota, I really recommend an upgrade.

Currently, quota works for ext2 type file system only. 
<sect>Requirements for Using Quota on Linux
<p>
<sect1>Kernel
<p>

The 2.x kernel source is available from
<code>http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/v2.0 
</code>
<sect1>Quota software
<p>

Depending on the Linux distribution you have, you may, or may not have
 the quota softwares installed on your system. If you don't, then download the
 quota software source from 
<code>ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/subsystems/quota/all.tar.gz.
</code>
<sect>Quota Setup on Linux - Part I: The Configuration
<p>
<sect1>Reconfigure your kernel
<p>

Reconfigure your kernel and add quota support by typing y to:
<code>Quota support (CONFIG_QUOTA) [n] y
</code>
<sect1>Compile and install the quota softwares
<p>

The quota software source is available from
<code>ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/subsystems/quota/all.tar.gz 
</code>
<sect1>Modify your system init script to check quota and turn quota on at boot
 time
<p>

Here's an example:
<code>&num; Check quota and then turn quota on. 
if [ -x /usr/sbin/quotacheck ] 
        then 
               echo "Checking quotas. This may take some time." 
               /usr/sbin/quotacheck -avug 
               echo " Done." 
        fi 
         if [ -x /usr/sbin/quotaon ] 
        then 
                echo "Turning on quota." 
                /usr/sbin/quotaon -avug 
        fi
</code>

The golden rule is that always turn quota on after your file systems in
 /etc/fstab have been mounted, otherwise quota will fail to work. I recommend
 turning quota on at the end of your system init script, or, if you like, right
 after the part where file systems are mounted in your system init script.
<sect1>Modify /etc/fstab
<p>

Partitions that you have not yet enabled quota normally look something
 like:
<code>/dev/hda1       /       ext2    defaults        1       1
/dev/hda2       /usr    ext2    defaults        1       1
</code>

To enable user quota support on a file system, add "usrquota" to the fourth
 field containing the word "defaults" (man fstab for details).
<code>/dev/hda1       /       ext2    defaults        1       1
/dev/hda2       /usr    ext2    defaults,usrquota       1       1
</code>

Replace "usrquota" with "grpquota", should you need group quota support
 on a file system.
<code>/dev/hda1       /       ext2    defaults        1       1
/dev/hda2       /usr    ext2    defaults,grpquota       1       1
</code>

Need both user quota and group quota support on a file system?
<code>/dev/hda1       /       ext2    defaults        1       1
/dev/hda2       /usr    ext2    defaults,usrquota,grpquota       1   1
</code>
<sect1>Create quota record "quota.user" and "quota.group"
<p>

Both quota record files, quota.user and quota.group, should be owned by
 root, and read-write permission for root and none for anybody else.

Login as root. Go to the root of the partition you wish to enable quota,
 then create quota.user and quota.group by doing:
<code>touch /partition/quota.user 
touch /partition/quota.group 
chmod 600 /partition/quota.user 
chmod 600 /partition/quota.group
</code>
<sect1>Reboot
<p>

Now reboot system for the changes you have made to take effect.

Also note that subsequent partitions you wish to enable quota in the future
 only require step 4, 5, and 6.
<sect>Quota Setup on Linux - Part II: Assigning Quota for Users and Groups
<p>

This operation is performed with the edquota command (man edquota for details).

I would normally run quotacheck with the flags -avug to obtain the most
 updated filesystems usage prior to editing quota. This is just a personal habit,
 and not a required step however.
<sect1>Assigning quota for a particular user
<p>

Here's an example. I have a user with the login id bob on my system.  The
 command "edquota -u bob" takes me into vi (or editor specified in my &dollar;EDITOR
 environment variable) to edit quota for user bob on each partition that has
 quota enabled:
<code>Quotas for user bob: 
/dev/hda2: blocks in use: 2594, limits (soft = 5000, hard = 6500) 
         inodes in use: 356, limits (soft = 1000, hard = 1500)
</code>

"blocks in use" is the total number of blocks (in kilobytes) a user has
 comsumed on a partition.

"inodes in use" is the total number of files a user has on a partition.
<sect1>Assigning quota for a particular group
<p>

Now I have a group games on my system. "edquota -g games" takes me into
 the vi editor again to edit quota for the group games:
<code>        Quotas for group games: 
        /dev/hda4: blocks in use: 5799, limits (soft = 8000, hard = 10000) 
                inodes in use: 1454, limits (soft = 3000, hard = 4000)
</code>
<sect1>Assigning quota for a bunch of users with the same value
<p>

To rapidly set quotas for, say 100 users, on my system to the same value
 as my user bob, I would first edit bob's quota information by hand, then execute:
<code>edquota -p bob `awk -F: '&dollar;3 &gt; 499 {print &dollar;1}' /etc/passwd`
</code>

assuming that you are using csh, and that you assign your user UID's starting
 with 500.

In addition to edquota, there are 3 terms which you should familiarize
 yourself with: Soft Limit, Hard Limit, and Grace Period.
<sect1>Soft Limit
<p>

_Soft limit_ indicates the maximum amount of disk usage a quota user has
 on a partition. When combined with grace period, it acts as the border line,
 which a quota user is issued warnings about his impending quota violation when
 passed.
<sect1>Hard Limit
<p>

Hard limit works only when grace period is set. It specifies the absolute
 limit on the disk usage, which a quota user can't go beyond his hard limit.
<sect1>Grace Period
<p>

Executed with the command "edquota -t", grace period is a time limit  before
 the soft limit is enforced for a file system with quota enabled. Time units
 of sec(onds), min(utes), hour(s), day(s), week(s), and month(s) can be used.
 This is what you'll see with the command "edquota -t":
<code>Time units may be: days, hours, minutes, or seconds 
Grace period before enforcing soft limits for users: 
/dev/hda2: block grace period: 0 days, file grace period: 0 days 
</code>

Change the 0 days part to any length of time you feel reasonable. I personally
 would choose 7 days (or 1 week).
<sect>Miscellaneous Quota Commands
<p>
<sect1>Quotacheck
<p>

Quotacheck is used to scan a file system for disk usages, and updates the
 quota record file "quota.user" to the most recent state. I recommend running
 quotacheck at system bootup, or via cronjob periodically (say, every week?).
<sect1>Repquota
<p>

Repquota produces a summarized quota information for a file system. Here
 is a sample output repquota gives:
<code>&num; repquota -a 
                                Block limits               File limits 
        User            used    soft    hard  grace    used  soft  hard  grace 
        root      --  175419       0       0          14679     0     0 
        bin       --   18000       0       0            735     0     0 
        uucp      --     729       0       0             23     0     0 
        man       --      57       0       0             10     0     0 
        user1     --   13046   15360   19200            806  1500  2250 
        user2     --    2838    5120    6400            377  1000  1500
</code>
<sect1>Quotaon and Quotaoff
<p>

Quotaon is used to turn on quota accouting; quotaoff to turn it off. Actually
 both files are similar. They are executed at system startup and shutdown.
