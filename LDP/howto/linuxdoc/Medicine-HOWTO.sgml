<sect1>About the Author(s)
<p>
Gerardo Arnaez: I am an internal medicine doctor. I am extremely concerned with the state of medical informatics. 
<p>
Werner Heuser: Working as a system administrator in the computer departments of two German hospitals I get inspired to search for medical applications created with Linux software. Besides this HOWTO I have written the <url url="http://mobilix.org/howtos.html" name="Linux-Mobile-Guide">, <url url="http://mobilix.org/howtos.html" name="Linux-Infrared-HOWTO"> and the <url url="http://mobilix.org/eco_linux.html" name="Linux-Ecology-HOWTO">.

<sect>Community
<p>
<sect1>LinuxMedNews
<p> <url url="http://www.LinuxMedNews.org/" name="LinuxMedNews"> is a site designed to facilitate, amplify and begin the process of fundamentally changing medical education and practice into a more effective, fair and humane enterprise using modern technologies. The site uses Zope and a slashdot clone Squishdot to accomplish these goals. It is not intended to be doctor-centric, it is intended to be an interesting/fun forum and resource for anyone who has an interest in health care and open source.

<sect2>Last Update

<sect1>American Medical Informatics Association
<p><url url="http://www.amia.org" name="AMIA"> is a association that is quite a resource for the informatics community.  Unfortunately, they require a subscription to join, but I have found that some mailing-lists will add you.  I have found the cs-wg mailing list the most interesting, with some of the best discussion going around. The discussion are extremely good and informative.


<!-- MEDICAL RECORD APPLICATIONS -->


<sect>Medical Record Applications
<p>

<sect1> VISTA (DHCP)
<p> <url url="http://www.hardhats.net" name="VISTA"> is a huge, VA hospital funded project, electron medical records system.  I used this system, when I was a resident, in the Va hospital, and it simply was the best system (that I had used). I'm actually surprised that not more people know about this. I am not sure about the license, but the software and documentation is available under the Freedom of Information Act, but you need to send <url url="http://hardhats.org/foia.html" name="REQUESTS"> to get access to the software on CD. They are currently starting to host more and more of the code online, though.

<sect1>SQL Clinic
<p>
<url url="http://www.sqlclnic.net" name="sqlclinic"> is an impressive application that was developed for mental health workers, sponsored by their local hospital. What is most impressive is the amount of documentation. However it is unclear how useful the application would be for other non mental-health professionals.
<sect2>Last Update:
<p>Feb 2, 20002

<sect1>Electronic Obstetrical Record System
<p>
<url url="http://www.eors.org" name="eors"> is a quite a well-developed medical management system used by the developers themselves in their OB practice.  The layout is somewhat Star Trek-ish, but quite useful and well developed
<sect2>Last Update:
<p>Unclear



<sect1>Freemed
<p>
<url url="http://www.freemed.org/" name="freemed"> is a medical management software package that runs in a web browser window. It currently uses Apache, an SQL backend (usually MySQL, but there's an SQL Abstraction for this), and PHP, and is non-browser specific. It aims to duplicate all of the functionality of programs such as The Medical Manager, while remaining free to the community.
<sect2>Last Update
<p>Unclear. July 9, 2001 ?

<sect1>Freemed-YiRC
<p>
<url url="http://freemed-yirc.familyandyouth.org/" name="Freemed-YiRC"> is a PHP package based on Freemed for use with Youth in Residential Care (YiRC) agencies. Its aim is to be a complete package to replace legacy non-free apps which aren't customizable. Since it's PHP-based, all that is needed for the client is a good Web browser with extensive table support. It can use both Postgres and MySql databases

<sect1>Good Electronic Health Record - GEHR
<p>
The <url url="http://www.gehr.org/" name="Good Electronic Health Record (GEHR)"> , a major part of the work of the openEHR Foundation, is an evolving electronic health record architecture designed to be comprehensive, portable and medico-legally robust. It has been developed from the <url url="http://www.chime.ucl.ac.uk/HealthI/GEHR/" name="Good European Health Record project"> requirements statement and object model- the most comprehensive requirements documents ever developed for the electronic health record. This website is a public resource for documents and resources that have been used to build implementations of this record.

<p> Last Update: Jan, 14 2002
<p>The main point of this site is to try to setup standards.

<sect1>Conversion of ECGs - ecg2png
<p>
<url url="http://www.cardiothink.com/downloads/ecg2png/" name="ecg2png"> converts scanned 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) into PNG format and a web-friendly image size. The problems this program solves are that an ECG scanned at relatively high resolution puts a large memory load on the Web browser because it contains about 6 million color pixels. Also, typical scanners convert a clean paper ECG into many colors, not just red, black, and white. The resulting file cannot be compressed efficiently and takes more time to transmit over low-speed network connections. This program shrinks the image while preserving the signal and cleans up the color map, yielding a bitmap that is well-suited for Web-based distribution of ECG images.

<p>
Probably in most countries, but for sure in Germany, about 80% of administrative software used in medical doctor's practices are still based on the antique DOS operating system. Slowly, programs using modern graphical user interfaces (GUI) reach a share of the market. Most of them is based on one of the buggy but nevertheless expensive MS WINDOWS operating systems.
<p>
When having bought a system, the user (doctor) is tied up to the provider and its updates that cost. Those are necessary due to steady changes in public health system and technical progress.
<p>

<sect1>REALTIQ - ReAligning Tissue Quantifier
<p>
REALTIQ stands for <it>Re-aligning Tissue Quantification</it>, the software is currently in the alpha-stage. 
<p>
Software Features:
<itemize>
<item>Re-align any patient-scan to new arbitrary axes by tri-linear interpolation 
<item>Segmentation of long-bone tissue 
<item>Quantification of long-bone tissue 
<item>DICOM compatible 
</itemize>

<p>
Description: A pre-version of this software was developed for use in a study on the relations of the medullary-canal dimensions and the cortical-bone area at patients suffering from arthritic bone-disease. 
<p>
The problem with CAT data is, that if the model (in this case the hand/finger) is not properly aligned with the CAT axis, the cut-planes will only display a distorted view of the bone and quantitative measurement will yield high error-rates. 
<p>
REALTIQ reads in a set of DICOM images and displays it to the viewer as a frontal, sagittal and transversal view. The user can specify, intuitively by using the mouse, an axis through this data, as well as a bounding-box around that axis. The dataset will be mapped to that new axis, so that the structures of interest are now properly aligned. In a second step, the software calculates: 

<itemize>
<item>Medullary-canal diameters (in several directions) 
<item>Medullary-canal area / absorption rate 
<item>Cortical-bone diameters (in several directions) 
<item>Cortical-bone area / absorption rate 
</itemize>

[004] - BMI 1.0

About: BMI is a tool to help dieting people.  It calculates your Body Mass
Index (BMI) and gives you an indication of your fatness. It saves the
results in a file, so you can through the program look at the file, and
compare your results from one day to another. This gives you an overlook of
your weight development over a period of time.
