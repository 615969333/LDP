   The Ecology-HOWTO discusses ways Linux computers can be used as a means to
   protect our environment, by using its features to save power or paper. Since
   it does not require big hardware, Linux may be used with old computers to
   make their life cycle longer. Games may be used in environmental education
   and software is available to simulate ecological processes.

Some of the recommendations in this text are discussed controversial, for instance: powering down a device, when it's not in use. This may save power, but not under all circumstances. Also it may have other additional ecological costs, e.g. the life time of the device can be shortened.

<title>Linux Compatibility Check</title>

<para>
From the Battery-Powered-mini-HOWTO &quot; .. for APM to work on any notebook or energy-conscious desktop, the system BIOS ROM in the machine must support the APM standard. Furthermore, for APM to work with the Linux operating system, the system BIOS ROM must support either the 1.0 or 1.1 version of the APM standard, and it must also support 32-bit protected mode connections. A system that supports APM 1.1 is preferred, as it provides more features that the device driver and supporting utilities can take advantage of.&quot;
You may get information about the APM version with the <command>dmesg</command> command and in the <filename>/proc/apm</filename> file.

<title>Introduction</title>


<para>
When you first install Linux, you will probably have to recompile the kernel. The kernel that came with your distribution probably does not have APM enabled.
</para>

<para>
APM support consists of two parts: <command>kernel</command> support and <command>user-land</command> support.
</para>

<para>
For <command>kernel</command> support, enable the parameters in the corresponding kernel section. AFAIK not all features work with laptops. AFAIK the feature <command>CONFIG_APM_POWER_OFF</command> works with most laptops.
</para>

<para>
The utilities for <command>userland</command> support may be found at <ulink url="http://www.worldvisions.ca/~apenwarr/apmd/">WorldVisions</ulink>. APMD is a set of programs that control the Advanced Power Management system found in most modern laptop computers. If you run a 2.2.x kernel and want to experiment, Gabor Kuti &lt;seasons at falcon.sch.bme.hu&gt; has made a kernel patch that allows you to <command>hibernate</command> any Linux system to disk, even if your computers APM BIOS doesn't support it directly.

If you have another operating system preinstalled or use another operating system at the same disk, make sure there is no "hibernation" or "suspend" tool installed, which could severely interfere with Linux, e.g. it might use disk space which is occupied by Linux or vice versa.

If your machine worked with 2.0.x kernels but not with the 2.2.x series, take this advice from Klaus Franken kfr at klaus.franken.de : "The default changed in 2.2. Search in the init-scripts for <command>halt</command> and change it to <command>halt -p</command> or <command>poweroff</command>. See <command>man halt</command> , if you don't have this option you need a newer version of <command>halt</command>." You may find it in the <command>SysVinit</command> package.
</para>

<para>
Sometimes X windows and APM don't work smoothly together, the machine might even hang. A recommendation from Steve Rader: Some Linux systems have their X server hang when doing <command>apm -s</command>. Folks with this affliction might want switch to the console virtual terminal then suspend <command>chvt 1; apm -s</command> as root, or, more appropiately.<command>sudo chvt 1; sudo apm -s</command>. I have these commands in a script, say, <command>my-suspend</command> and then do <command>xapmload --click-command my-suspend</command> .

We have seen a few of these recently, except all the others are in the power off code in the BIOS wher we can work around it by returning to real mode before attempting to power off. Here we cannot do this."

<title>Screensavers</title>


<para>
Do they only prevent the screen from being burned in or do they save power, too?
</para>

<para>
Some recommendations from Wade W. Hampton:
Screensavers usually display graphics, look for ETI, or perform other tasks.  When using your screensaver in this manner, you may actually consume MORE power. For example a computer using XSETI as a screensaver might get far warmer (hence use more power) than when it was being used to edit a document or perform a compile.

To really save power, and if your X server plus monitor supports it, use the <command>dpms</command> option of <command>xset</command> (see the manual page for <command>xset</command>). For example, to enable the DPMS (Energy Star) features of you X server: <command>xset +dpms</command>

You may also manually change the mode of your X display: 
<programlisting>
xset dpms force standby
xset dpms force suspend
xset dpms force off
</programlisting>

</para>

<para>
AFAIK a CRT consumes on the order of 25 percent more power when displaying a <command>plain white</command> screen than displaying a <command>plain black</command> screen. So, a screensaver that's mostly black can help save power, even if it doesn't actually use DPMS to power down the screen. Of course, one that's very bright and colourful, or that keeps the CPU running fast is not much help.
</para>


<para>
Some screen saver programs:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
The purpose of <command>xscreensaver</command> is to display pretty pictures
on your screen when it is not in use, in keeping with the philosophy that
unattended monitors should always be doing something interesting, just like
they do in the movies. The benefit that this program has over the
combination of the <command>xlock</command> and
<command>xautolock</command> programs is the ease with which new graphics
hacks can be  installed: you don't need to recompile this program to add a
new display mode, you just change some resource settings. Any program which
can be  invoked in such a way that it draws on the root window of the screen
can now be used as a screensaver without modification.  The programs that
are being run as screensavers don't need to have any special knowledge about
what it means to be a screensaver.

I had a chance to discuss Energy Star with the designers of desktop printers. They confirmed that the allowable stand-by power targets depend on the device, and they only knew their targets. But they made some other interesting comments: 

<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>
Energy Star ratings lead to significant operational power savings. Timer based power savings are the exception. Most savings come from designing in power on demand with low leakage drivers. For example, using stepper motors with low leakage current instead of high leakage.
</para>
<para>
This savings is both from individual designs and from the resulting demand for low leakage products causing better and cheaper low leakage product designs. The old-style (e.g. typewriter) design with one motor (always on) and various clutches is no longer the least cost.
</para>

</listitem>



<listitem>
<para>
Energy Star was good organizational engineering. It never required designers to compromise quality or performance, which made it much harder to argue against design changes to reduce power consumption while idle. Since most of the savings begin the millisecond that parts stop moving, these savings are considerable.
</para>
</listitem>


<listitem>
<para>
The power ratings on PC's are a safety rating, not a usage rating. So the 235W and 300W power supplies that commonly found in PCs are specifying their safety limits. Actual full power usage is much less, typically 20-30 percent of the safe limit. The designers also noted that it is actually difficult to measure the power consumption of a switching power supply. You need to use specially designed power meters. The regular AC meters are designed for motors, and are rather inaccurate for switching power supplies.

Linux halts the CPU in the idle cycle to further reduce power consumption. Early reports of OS/2, Win3.1/95, NT, and Linux showed Linux to use far less power than DOS-based O/S's that spun in the idle loop and consumed power -- this may have changed hence it would need research to validate.

</para>

<para>
<command>-jfirst[-last][%interval]</command>
</para>

<para>
Print just the selected sheets, specified  by  number,  starting at 1.  Here last defaults to the end of data, interval to 1.  Thus  -j1-10  selects  the first  10 sheets, while -j 1%2 prints just the odd- numbered sheets and -j 2%2  prints  just  the  even ones.

You can do double-sided printing, in two passes, as follows. If you use 3-hole punched paper, put it in  the  printer such that the holes will appear at the top of the page -- on the right as you pull out the  printer  tray,  in  our  Laser  writer II NTX. Print the odd-numbered sheets with
</para>

<para>
<command>-j 1%2 ...</command>
</para>

<para>
Note the number of pages it  reports.   (Only  half this  many  will really be printed).  When printing finishes, if mpage reported an odd number of pages, remove  the  last  one  from the stack, since there will be no even-numbered sheet to match  it.   Then arrange  the  stack  of  paper  for printing on the other side.  (If it's punched, the holes  will  now be  on  the  left.)  On our II NTX, the paper comes out blank-side up; replace it  in  the  tray  still blank-side  up  but rotated 180 degrees.  For other printers, you figure it out.  Now print  the  even- numbered sheets in reverse order with
</para>

<para>
<command>-r -j 2%2 ...</command>
</para>

hoping  no  one else reaches the printer before you do.

Reading is slower up to 30 percent, see <ulink url="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9602.html">N.N.</ulink>.

Another means of saving paper is through the use of comments and redline/strikeout markings when exchanging a document with a co-worker/colaborator. For example, a draft could be written using WordPerfect, then E-MAILed to a co-worker. They could update the draft and send it back to you. You can use WordPerfect's redline/strikeout features to see the changes. The document need not be printed until it is "final" or in "final draft" status.

You should purchase smaller computers and monitors when possible. This will save packaging material translating into less solid waste. For example the box for a 15" CRT monitor is 2-3 times the size of the box for a 15" LCD monitor. Linux works well with 15" LCD monitors on smaller computers like the Netwinder or <ulink url="http://www.thinworks.com/campaign/try_e3000.html">E3000</ulink> .
</para>

<para>
Tough smaller monitors may have another ecological caveat: because it's inconvenient to browse to longer documents, people may tend to print the documents instead of reading them from the screen.
</para>

<para>
Some have expressed the concern that LCD displays may use more toxic materials and manufacturing processes than CRT displays, hence their usage actually may be worse on the environment. The original information above concerned the solid waste issue, which is fairly tangible and hence more controllable.

Depending on wordlength and paragraphlength a multi-column layout sometimes saves paper space (though the likelihood for a word to be broken increases, on the other hand the space used by incomplete lines at the end of paragraphs decreases).

Check the memory usage with <command>free</command> and <command>top</command>.

<ulink url="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/mergemem/">Mergemem Project </ulink>. Many programs contain <command>memory areas of the same content</command> that remain undetected by the operating system. Typically, these areas contain data that have been generated on startup and remain unchanged for longer periods. With <command>mergemem</command> such areas are detected and shared. The sharing is performed on the operating system level and is invisible to the user level programs. <command>mergemem</command> is particularily useful if you run many instances of interpreters and emulators (like Java or Prolog) that keep their code in private data areas. But also other programs can take advantage albeit to a lesser degree.

You may also reduce the <command>kernel size</command> as much as possible by removing any feature which is not necessary for your needs and by modularizing the kernel as much as possible.

Also you may shutdown every service or <command>daemon</command> which is not needed, e.g. <command>lpd</command>, <command>mountd</command>, <command>nfsd</command> and close some <command>virtual consoles</command>. Please see Small-Memory-mini-HOWTO for details.

BOA - "Lightweight and High Performance WebServer.
<command>boa</command> is a single-tasking HTTP server. That means that
unlike traditional web servers, it does not fork for each incoming
connection, nor does it fork many copies of itself to handle multiple
connections. It internally multiplexes all of the ongoing HTTP connections,
and forks only for CGI programs (which must be separate processes.)
Preliminary tests show boa is capable of handling several hundred hits per
second on a 100 MHz Pentium."

virtual terminal provides the functions of the DEC VT100 terminal
and, in addition, several control functions from the ANSI X3.64

NiCad batteries need to be discharged periodically to prevent the memory effect and prolong their lifespan. 

Batteries such as NiCad, Lead Acid, and NiMH contain TOXIC chemicals. Techniques should be taken to prolong their lifespan, and when you do discard them, they should be recycled, not thrown in the trash. 

One technology to watch is the "Iron" battery mentioned in the article at <ulink url="http://news.excite.com/news/r/990815/01/science-battery-iron">N.N.</ulink> . Such a battery could reduce some of the toxic waste problems associated with used batteries, however such a battery is probably a few years away.

The objective of the <ulink url="http://home.zonnet.nl/vanrein/badram/">BadRAM Patch</ulink> is to run the Linux kernel in such a way that it can handle defective RAM modules. With defective RAM, I mean RAM which has some bits wrong at some (known) addresses. Normally, such RAM is considered useless and thrown away; the larger RAMs get, the higher the chances of failing addresses. With ever growing RAM sizes, it would therefore be pleasant to have an alternative to discarding of defective RAM chips.

Or you can buy an older computer (SGI, Sun, NeXT) that comes with unix and is capable of running a wide range of open source software. In some cases (SGI Indigo2) you can still run current OS versions, in others you may do better with an open source OS such as Linux, but in either case you have access to lots of good software and tools to write your own.

The lower power consumption of older computers means you get more reserve time from an UPS or can use a small alternative power source if you don't have access to "mains" power.

<title>Ecological Comparisons of Computers</title>

<para>
   Scientists of 
   <ulink url="http://www.reuse-computer.de">ReUse project</ulink>
   located at the 
   <ulink url="http://tu-berlin.de/">Technical University of Berlin</ulink> recently compared the
   energy consumption of different computer types along the life cycle. The
   production of computers actually needs 535 kWh which is 10 % less than 4
   years ago. Most of the energy will be consumed while the computer is used
   for example at work for 8 hours/day. The energy consumption of new
   computers with 2,5-3 GHz processors is even in the
   stand-bye-mode still 100 Watt, whereas a 1,4 GHz PC needs 80
   Watt and a 4 year old PC only needed 60 Watt. Therefore from the
   ecological point of view it is better to buy an old computer
   that didn't need the energy for a new production and which
   consumes less electricity while it is being used.
</para>

<para>
   LCD displays need less energy than other monitors. For this reason
   laptops are the most ecological types of the compared computers. They
   need the smallest amount of energy when they are used. And 3 year old
   laptops are better than new ones since their processors need less
   energy than new examples. There is also an article in the
   German computer magazine
   <ulink url="http://heise.de/ct/">C't 21/ 2003</ulink>.

<title>PCMCIA Card Services and Advanced Power Management</title>


<para>
Quoted from the <ulink url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/PCMCIA-HOWTO.html">LDP - PCMCIA-HOWTO </ulink>: &quot;Card Services can be compiled with support for APM (Advanced Power Management) if you've configured your kernel with APM support. ...  The PCMCIA modules will automatically be configured for APM if a compatible version is detected on your system. Whether or not APM is configured, you can use <command>cardctl suspend</command> before suspending your laptop, and <command>cardctl resume</command> after resuming, to cleanly shut down and restart your PCMCIA cards. This will not work with a modem that is in use, because the serial driver isn't able to save and restore the modem operating parameters. APM seems to be unstable on some systems. If you experience trouble with APM and PCMCIA on your system, try to narrow down the problem to one package or the other before reporting a bug. Some drivers, notably the PCMCIA SCSI drivers, cannot recover from a suspend/resume cycle.  When using a PCMCIA SCSI card, always use <command>cardctl eject</command> prior to suspending the system.&quot;
</para>

<para>
You should use the internal modem in a laptop instead of a PCMCIA modem, if possible (it may be a WinModem).

If you don't need infrared support,
disable it in the BIOS or shutdown the
IrDA device driver. There are also some
IrDA features of the kernel which are
useful for saving power.

In the specifications of my HP
OmniBook 800 it is recommended to turn
off the IR port, if it is not in use,
because it may consume up to 10
percent of the battery time.

If necessary, you may also try to
disable the <command>Fast
RRs</command> feature in the IrDA
section of the kernel. This option
will give you much better latencies
but will consume more power.

<title>Appendix D - Recommendations for Buying a New Computer</title>


<para>
Courtesy of Wade W. Hampton (modifications by wh): Purchase a low-power computer such as a laptop or network computer. These typically don't use as much power as desktop systems. For example, someone on the WWW had a Corel/Rebel Netwinder powered by solar cells. I find it funny that an "Energy Star" desktop still has a 300W power supply and uses far more power than a computer like the Netwinder which uses something like 10 Watts of power, (though this is consistent with the Energy Star goals for computer equipment, since they have targeted unused power consumption).
</para>

<para>
Maybe there should be a new class of computers called "Energy Miser" (or similar) that use nearly an order of magnitude less power than Energy Star systems?
</para>

<para>
To save power for the display, one could purchase a LCD monitor instead of a CRT. LCD monitors consume 30-40 Watts of power versus the 100's of Watts used by most monitors.  The price of an LCD is still 2-3 times that of a similar monitor, but as LCDs become more widely used, the price will come down.
</para>

<para>
Make sure that any new computer purchase includes APM-compliant hardware and low-radiation. Use TCO, DPMS or Energy Star compliant monitors.
</para>

R Horn &lt;rjh at world.std.com&gt; wrote: " I personally have found the <ulink url="http://eande.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley Labs - LBL</ulink> web site to be the best source for information on energy efficient equipment. They go into considerable details on how to reduce energy consumption from many kinds of equipment, including much more than computers.  They also have a good collection of links to related sites. The Energy Star program is defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency, which has a web site on it. So far all of the Energy Star regulations have been defined to reduce energy usage without requireing change or restrictions on regular usage.  There is an amazingly large amount of electricity consumed by idle equipment (computers, televisions, microwave ovens,...) and also large amounts consumed unnecessarily by equipment that must be continuously one (emergency exit signs, traffic lights, ...). Since this energy can be saved without asking users to make any compromises on performance, it is being targeted first.
</para>

<para>
Somewhere on the LBL web site they have the actual power consumption figures for various PCs. The 300W power supply is quite misleading. Actual power usage varies depending upon what programs you run and whether the disks can be powered down. Genuine usage while in operation is usually in the 50-75W range. When the system is idle, it drops significantly.
</para>

<para>
The NetWinder is a nice machine, but does force operational compromises. The peak CPU performance is much lower.  The operating system is not Windows.  And there are other limitations. A closer comparison is the typical laptop PC.  These can generally be operated from a modest solar panel because their average power drain is quite low.  With these you can see the cost vs power consumption tradeoff. They achieve the same performance as the desktop units, but the low power consumption has doubled or tripled the cost.
</para>

<para>
(I personally use a Psion.  A decent slow computer that requires only 200mw of power. It may even run Linux once they deal with some of the ROM issues.)
</para>

<para>
The big debate in setting the energy star regulations was deciding which would have greater overall benefit: small negligible cost improvements to almost all equipment sold, or greater improvements at much higher cost? Could that cost be invested elsewhere to greater benefit?  How will the purchasers react to the higher cost? So far the consensus has been that improving a large number of machines at negligible cost is wiser than improving a smaller number of machines at high cost."

<title>Appendix E - A New Environmentally Friendly Hardware Design</title>


<para>
Courtesy of Wade W. Hampton and Knut Suebert: New hardware designs that plan to use Linux should take advantage of environmentally friendly technologies such as low-power CPUs e.g., the ARM from: <ulink url="http://developer.intel.com/design/strong/">Intel</ulink>, environmentally friendly battery design, low-power displays (e.g., non-backlit LCDs), smaller packaging, etc.  Linux supports a WIDE variety of hardware and technologies. These could be leveraged into powerful, flexible, environmentally friendly Linux-based solutions. 

An "Environmental Rating" could be created for new Linux-based hardware and even some Linux-based software such as <command>bottlerocket</command> (X10). Devices such as the Netwinder or the uCsimm would receive high ratings for their size, power consumption, capabilities, etc.
