<SECT1 ID="pamnss"> <TITLE>LDAP authentication using pam_ldap and
nss_ldap</TITLE>


<PARA> This section focuses on how to use LDAP as a NIS substitute
for user accounts management. Having a lot of user accounts on several hosts
often causes misalignments in the accounts configuration. LDAP can be used to
build a centralized authentication system thus avoiding data replication and
increasing data consistency.</PARA> 

<PARA> At the moment the most used method to distribute users account data and
other information through a network is the Network Information Service (NIS).
Like LDAP, NIS is a distributed service that allows to have a central server
where configuration files such as passwd, shadow, groups, services,hosts etc.
are kept. The NIS server is queried by NIS clients to retrieve this information.
</PARA> 

<PARA> LDAP can offer the same functionality of NIS, moreover there are several
advantages on using LDAP: </PARA> 

<itemizedlist> 

<listitem> <PARA> Information on the LDAP server can be easily used for several
purposes. As outlined in this HOWTO, the same users entries on the LDAP database
can be used for other applications like phone directories, mail routing, staff
databases etc., thus avoiding data replication and inconsistency. </PARA>
</listitem> 

<listitem> <PARA> LDAP allows complex access control lists to be applied on the
database. This allows for a fine grain tuning of permissions on the database
entries. </PARA> </listitem> 


<listitem>
<PARA> A secure transmission channel between the LDAP server and the clients
can be implemented through the Secure Socket Layer (SSL). </PARA></listitem>

<listitem> <PARA> A fault tolerant service can be implemented using slapd
replication  <FOOTNOTE> <PARA> A mechanism that permits LDAP database
replication between servers. </PARA> </FOOTNOTE> and DNS round robin queries
(this is not covered in this document). </PARA> </listitem> 

<listitem> <PARA>Having a single instance of users on the network helps to
maintain users on many hosts from a single management point (i.e. you can
create and delete accounts in the LDAP server and this changes are available
immediately to LDAP clients). </PARA> </listitem> 

</itemizedlist> 


<PARA> Herein I'll focus on how an LDAP server can be used for authentication
and authorization on systems providing the Pluggable Authentication Module
(PAM) and the Name Service Switch (NSS) technologies, in particular I'll refer
to the Linux operating system even if this instructions can be applied to other
operating systems. </PARA> 


<PARA> The environment proposed consists of an LDAP server where users account
data is stored in a convenient format and a set of Un*x clients using this
information to authenticate and authorize users on resources in a standard Un*x
fashion. </PARA>

<PARA> A secure channel is also required in client/server communications since
critical information such as user account data, should not be sent in clear
over the network, this channel will be provided by the Secure Socket Layer.
</PARA> 

<PARA> On the client side a caching mechanism, needed for performance issues,
can be provided by the Name Service Caching Daemon. </PARA>

<PARA> All (almost) the software used to build this system is Open Source.
</PARA> 


<SECT2> <TITLE> The components of the framework </TITLE>
 
 
<PARA> This section outlines the various components that
are used to build the authentication system. For each component is given a
brief description. </PARA>

<SECT3> <TITLE> Authentication: PAM and pam_ldap.so</TITLE>


<PARA> The Pluggable Authentication Module allows integration of
various authentication technologies such as standard UNIX, RSA, DCE, LDAP etc.
into system services such as login, passwd, rlogin, su, ftp, ssh etc. without
changing any of these services. </PARA>

<PARA> First implemented by Sun Solaris, PAM is now the standard authentication
framework of many Linux distributions, including RedHat and Debian. It provides
an API through which authentication requests are mapped into technology
specific actions (implemented in the so called pam modules). This mapping is
done by PAM configuration files, in which, for each service are basically given
the authentication mechanisms to use. </PARA> 

<PARA> In our case, the pam_ldap module, implemented in the shared library
pam_ldap.so, allows user and group authentication using an LDAP service.
</PARA> 

<PARA> Each service that needs an authentication facility, can be configured
through the PAM configuration files to use different authentication methods.
This means that it is possible, using the PAM configuration files, to write a
custom list of requirements that an user must satisfy to obtain access to a
resource. </PARA> 

</SECT3> 

<SECT3> <TITLE> The Name Service Switch and nss_ldap.so </TITLE> <PARA> Once an user is
authenticated, many applications still need access to user information. This
information is traditionally contained in text files (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow,
and /etc/group) but can also be provided by other name services. </PARA>

<PARA>
As a new name service (such as LDAP) is introduced it can be implemented either
in the C library (as it was for NIS and DNS) or in the application that wants
to use the new nameservice. </PARA> 

<PARA> Anyway, this can be avoided using a
common, general purpose, name service API and by demanding to a set of
libraries the task of retrieving this information performing technology based
operations. </PARA> 

<PARA> This solution was adopted in the GNU C Library that
implements the Name Service Switch, a method originated form the Sun C library
that permits to obtain information from various name services through a common
API. </PARA>

 <PARA> NSS uses a common API and a configuration file
(/etc/nsswitch.conf) in which are specified the name service providers for
every supported database. </PARA>

<PARA> The databases currently supported by
NSS  <FOOTNOTE> <PARA> It is not a case that these are the maps provided by
NIS. </PARA> </FOOTNOTE> are: </PARA> 

<itemizedlist> 

<listitem> <PARA> aliases: Mail aliases .  </PARA> </listitem> 

<listitem> <PARA> ethers: Ethernet numbers.  </PARA> </listitem>

<listitem> <PARA> group: Groups of users.  </PARA> </listitem>

<listitem> <PARA> services: Network services.  </PARA> </listitem>

<listitem> <PARA> shadow: Shadow user passwords.  </PARA> </listitem>
</itemizedlist> 

<PARA> Using the nss_ldap shared library it is possible to implement the maps
above using LDAP, anyway here I'll focus only on the LDAP implementation of
shadow, passwd and group database tough all the maps above can be implemented.
</PARA> 

</SECT3>

 <SECT3> <TITLE> The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol </TITLE> 
 
<PARA> For our application LDAP is used to provide clients with information
about user accounts and user groups. The standard objectclasses that are used
to represent users and groups are: top, posixAccount, shadowAccount and
posixGroup. </PARA>

<PARA> Users entries on the database must belong at least  <FOOTNOTE> <PARA> An
entry can belong to several objectclasses. </PARA> </FOOTNOTE> to the top,
posixAccount and shadowAccount objectclasses. Group entries must belong to the
top and posixGroup objectclasses. </PARA>

<PARA> The implementation of pam_ldap and nss_ldap  <FOOTNOTE> <PARA> Actually
LDAP NSS recognize other objectclasses </PARA> </FOOTNOTE> that we use refers to this objectclasses, that
are described in RFC 2307.</PARA>

</SECT3>

<SECT3> <TITLE> The Name Service Caching Daemon </TITLE>

<PARA> The Name Service Caching Daemon (NSCD) is used to cache name service
lookups and can improve performance with the services provided by the NSS.
</PARA>

<PARA> It must be tuned with a large cache for passwd entries in order to have
acceptable performance on the client side. </PARA>

</SECT3> 

<SECT3> <TITLE> The Secure Socket Layer </TITLE>

<PARA> The Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is an application layer protocol that
provides a secure transmission channel between parties. It is based on public
key cryptography systems (RSA) and on X.509 certificates. </PARA>

<PARA> The SSL protocol provides: </PARA> 

<itemizedlist> 

<listitem> <PARA> data encryption: Client/server session is encrypted.  </PARA>
 </listitem>

<listitem> <PARA> server authentication: Client can verify the server
 identity.  </PARA> </listitem>

<listitem> <PARA> message integrity: Data is not modified during transmission. 
 </PARA> </listitem>

<listitem> <PARA> client authentication: Server can verify the client
 identity.  </PARA> </listitem>

</itemizedlist> 
  
<PARA> SSL is needed in the communication between the LDAP server and the
 clients libraries (pam_ldap.so and nss_ldap.so), since sensible data, such as
 password entries, needs to be encrypted between the client and the server. SLL
 also permits the client to uniquely identify the server, thus avoiding to
 obtain authentication informations from an untrusted source. </PARA>

<PARA> Client authentication (the server identifies the
 client) is not supported in the current implementation of pam_ldap and
 nss_ldap modules tough it may be useful. </PARA>

<PARA> Though this layout may seem quite complex to implement, most of the

<SECT3> <TITLE> Server side </TITLE> 

<PARA> On the server side an LDAP server must be installed and configured. The
LDAP server used is OpenLDAP <FOOTNOTE> <PARA> http://www.OpenLDAP.org
</PARA> </FOOTNOTE> an open source LDAP toolkit including an LDAP server
(slapd), library and utilities. </PARA>

<PARA>At the moment OpenLDAP comes with two implementation of LDAP: a V2
implementation (OpenLDAP 1.2.x) ad a V3 (OpenLDAP 2.0.x) implementation</PARA>

<PARA>The V3 implementation provides native SSL, the V2 doesn't. Anyway it is
possible to use an SSL wrapper to add SSL capabilities to the server (see
section about SSL).</PARA>


<SECT4> <TITLE> Installing and configuring OpenLDAP </TITLE>

<PARA> You can refer to the LDAP-HOWTO for instruction on installation and
configuration of LDAP </PARA>


<PARA> Once slapd is properly configured we need to insert some data for the
initial creation of the database. Therefore an LDIF (LDAP Data interchange
format) file must be created. This is a text file that can be imported in the
LDAP database with the command:</PARA>

<PARA> Here we defined the organization unit &ldquo;ou=Sezione di
Milano,o=Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, C=it&rdquo; under which are
contained two sub organizational units: people and groups. Then is described a

<PARA> The LDIF file must be imported in the server while it is not running
since the ldif2ldbm command builds the database directly, bypassing the LDAP
server. Once the LDIF file is imported into the database, the server can be
started. </PARA> 

</SECT4>


</SECT3>

<SECT3> <TITLE> Client side </TITLE>

<PARA> On the client side pam_ldap.so and nss_ldap.so are required and they
must be compiled using the Netscape LDAP Library (Mozilla) since it provides
the required LDAPS (LDAP over SSL) API. The library is distributed in a binary
package under Netscape One license and is not open source (it is public domain
anyway). </PARA>

<PARA> The package can be extracted, for example, in the directory
/usr/local/ldapsdk. </PARA>

<PARA> Client libraries must also have access to a certificate database
containing the LDAP (stunnel) server certificate and the CA certificate of the
CA that signed the server certificate (marked as trusted). </PARA>

<PARA> The certificate database must be in Netscape format since the Mozilla
LDAP API used to compile pam_ldap and nss_ldap uses certificate databases in
Netscape format. </PARA>

<PARA> To deal with such certificate databases it is convenient to use the
certutil utility found in the PKCS#11 package provided by Netscape 
<FOOTNOTE> <PARA> In a tricky way, it is also possible to use the Netscape
Communicator certificate database. </PARA> </FOOTNOTE>. </PARA>

<PARA> The main configuration file for LDAP clients is /etc/ldap.conf. </PARA> 

<SECT4> <TITLE> PAM LDAP Installation and Configuration </TITLE>

<PARA> To compile and install pam_ldap, do the following </PARA>

<PARA> <PROGRAMLISTING FORMAT="LINESPECIFIC">
$ ./configure --with-ldap-lib=netscape4
 \ --with-ldap-dir=/usr/local/ldapsdk
$ make
# make install
</PROGRAMLISTING></PARA>

<PARA> The configure switch --with-ldap-lib tells which LDAP library you are
going to use. </PARA>

<PARA> The switch --with-ldap-dir tells where you have installed your Netscape
ldapsdk toolkit. </PARA>

<PARA>This will install <FILENAME
MOREINFO="NONE">/lib/security/pam_ldap.so.1</FILENAME> and the various symlinks.
</PARA>

<PARA> PAM has to be properly configured in order to access the new
authentication system. PAM configuration files are located in the directory
/etc/pam.d and are named after the service for which authentication is
provided. </PARA>

<PARA> For example this is the PAM configuration file for the login service (in
a file named login). </PARA>

<PARA> <PROGRAMLISTING FORMAT="LINESPECIFIC">

<PARA> This files can be copied in the /etc/pam.d directory. Caution must be
given when performing this operation, since if something goes wrong you
probably will not be able to login again. It is suggested to make a backup copy
of /etc/pam.d before installing new files there and to leave an open privileged
shell. </PARA> 

<NOTE><PARA>In the example <FILENAME>pam.d</FILENAME> directory,
a <FILENAME>sshd</FILENAME> file is not present, so unless you
create one, you will be unable to login via ssh, if it uses pam (OpenSSH does
use PAM).</PARA></NOTE>

</SECT4>

<SECT4> <TITLE> NSS LDAP installation and configuration </TITLE> 

<PARA>After you've unpacked the sources, check the makefile. For most
configurations, it doesn't need to be edited. Anyway, if you want to use SSL
you must link against an SSL aware LDAP library, such as the Netscape one.
</PARA>

<PARA> Assuming that the ldap sdk is in /usr/local/ldapsdk you have to modify
the Makefile to enable SSL. Look for NSFLAGS in Makefile.linux.mozilla and
uncomment -DSSL. </PARA>

<PARA> Also check the LIBS definition to see if the ldapssl library specified
in the file is the same that you have installed (ldap_nss.so compiles with both
libldapssl40 and libldapssl30). </PARA>

<PARA> Then you can install the library: </PARA>

<PARA><PROGRAMLISTING FORMAT="LINESPECIFIC">
$ make -f Makefile.linux.mozilla
# make -f Makefile.linux.mozilla install	
#ldconfig	 
</PROGRAMLISTING></PARA>

<PARA>this installs <FILENAME>/lib/libnss_ldap.so</FILENAME>,
which is the nss_ldap library, and a set of example configuration files,
<FILENAME>/etc/nsswitch.ldap</FILENAME> and <FILENAME
MOREINFO="NONE">/etc/ldap.conf</FILENAME>, in case they do not exist
already.</PARA>

<PARA> Once you have installed it you must edit the NSS configuration file
<FILENAME>/etc/nsswitch.conf</FILENAME>. Tough LDAP can be used for all the
services we use it only for passwd, group and shadow therefore we should have
something like: </PARA>

<PARA><PROGRAMLISTING FORMAT="LINESPECIFIC"> 	
passwd: files ldap
group:  files ldap
shadow: files ldap
</PROGRAMLISTING></PARA>

<PARA> in the first lines of the configuration file. With this configuration,
entries are first looked in the system files and, if no value is returned, the
LDAP server is queried. </PARA> 

<NOTE><PARA>Beware when using ldap as backup for your dns lookups. If dns cannot
resolve the hostname, we're in infinite recursion, because libldap calls
gethostbyname(). [ from the nsswitch.ldap]</PARA></NOTE>


</SECT4> 

<SECT4> <TITLE> NSCD configuration </TITLE> 

<PARA> NSCD is already available in many Linux distributions, anyway it can be
found within the GNU C library package. </PARA>

<PARA> The NSCD configuration file is /etc/nscd.conf Each line specifies either
an attribute and a value, or an attribute, cachename, and a value. Fields are
separated either by SPACE or TAB characters. cachename can be hosts, passwd, or
groups (in our case we won't cache hosts). </PARA>

<PARA> <PROGRAMLISTING FORMAT="LINESPECIFIC">

keep-hot-count         group  20	
check-files            group  yes	 
</PROGRAMLISTING></PARA>

<PARA> Keep in mind that the nscd program caches passwd entries obtained from
LDAP. </PARA>

<PARA> This means that when an user is modified on the ldap server, the nscd
cache remains valid. This is avoided when using flat unix files by the
check-files directive that invalidates the cache when the corresponding file is
modified. Such a mechanism should be generalized, at the moment anyway does not
apply to LDAP. A way to avoid possible misalignments between the LDAP server
and the cache is to invalidate the cache manually when updating passwd entries
with the command: </PARA>

<PARA><PROGRAMLISTING FORMAT="LINESPECIFIC">
#nscd --invalidate=TABLE	
</PROGRAMLISTING></PARA>

<PARA> Where TABLE can be passwd, groups or hosts. </PARA>

<PARA> To avoid confusion when testing, do not use nscd. </PARA>

<PARA> Moreover using nss and nscd will produce a lot of open filedescriptors,
so is easy to run out of available filedescriptors on the system (this can hang
your system).</PARA>

<PARA> You can increase the maximum number of filedescriptors in a Linux box
(Kernel 2.2.x) with something like: </PARA>

<PARA><PROGRAMLISTING FORMAT="LINESPECIFIC">
#echo 16384 > /proc/sys/fs/file-max
</PROGRAMLISTING></PARA>

<PARA> The maximum number of filedescriptors suggested for a system depends
anyway from the configuration of your system. </PARA>

<PARA> The pam_groupdn directive is useful when an LDAP server provides
authentication information to a pool of clients, but the user should be
authorized only on a set of clients. This directive can provide the same
functionality of NIS netgroups. </PARA>

<PARA> The SSL configuration directives are not documented in the package, but
they tell to enable SSL and where the file containing the LDAP server
certificate and the CA certificate is stored. </PARA>

<PARA> A Netscape certificate database named cert7.db is searched in sslpath.
This file must contain the server certificate and the CA certificate (unless
the server certificate is self signed). There are two ways to generate this
file: using the Netscape PKCS#11 tools or using the Netscape browser.
</PARA>

<PARA> With the Netscape browser, after you have started slapd and stunnel on
the server you can use Netscape Navigator to connect to the URL
https://your.ldap.server:636/, you will be prompted to insert the server
certificate in your database. Also the CA certificate (provided by your CA)
must be loaded in the database (unless you are using a self signed
certificate). At this point you can copy the $HOME/.netscape/cert7.db in
sslpath. It is preferred that you use a scratch account with a default cert7.db
file since other server certificates, that may be present in your personal
certificate database, will be considered by your client as trusted
authentication servers. Once the browser has imported the server certificate it
can be used to debug SSL since it will behave like the pam and nss libraries.

<PARA> Unfortunately these general purpose tools are not intended for Un*x
accounts maintenance. The one that seems to be enough versatile is the LDAP
Browser/Editor that allows to set passwords in various formats and can use SSL
to connect to the server. </PARA>

<PARA> As it is for NIS with a single master server (no slave servers), LDAP
without a replication mechanism represents a single point of failure for the
authentication system. For authentication purposes it is rather important to
implement LDAP replication. The server that cames with OpenLDAP (slapd) provides
replication capabilities. </PARA> </SECT2>

<PARA> The following are the file permissions that should be applied to some of
the files used by the authentication system. </PARA>
