<abstract><para>

Troubleshooting a Linux-related issue is often perceived as a difficult 
task. But, often, the solution is just a few clicks away on the 
internet.

</para>
<para>

This document will direct Linux users to resources available on the 
Internet that provide access to a vast amount of Linux-related 
information useful in the troubleshooting problems.

</para></abstract>

</articleinfo>

<sect1 id="intro">

<title>Introduction</title>

<para>

The traditional means of troubleshooting computer-related problems 
involves consulting user's manuals, books, friends - probably enticed 
with goodies - and, when all the former do not yield a solution, calling 
the technical support service of the vendor of the product in question. 
And, we all know pleasant and reliably efficacious the latter stratagem 
is. Unfortunately, this is the norm in the sphere of commercial 
proprietary products.

</para>

<para>

In contradistinction, Linux, and related distributions, utilities and 
applications software, have largely been developed according to the 
<ulink url="http://www.opensource.org" >Open Source</ulink> model, 
wherein developers have used electronic communication over the Internet 
- typically in the form of publically-accessible Mailing Lists - to 
collaborate with their peers in the refinement of the associated source 
code. Such collaboration has also traditionally involved the online 
publication of user's manuals, lists of Frequently-Asked-Questions 
(FAQ's), knowledge bases, release notes, formal guides such as this 
document (HOWTO's) and tutorials. In addition, users often assist others 
through the forum of Usenet and other newsgroups and the posted messages 
are readily accessible in the form of searchable archives. These 
linux-related newsgroups are renowned for their high level of user 
participation. In significant measure, Linux may be considered a product 
of the Internet.

</para>

<para>

Considered together, these resources enable access to a large, 
ever-expanding factual database, and my intent is to encourage and 
direct the reader to utilize these repositories when faced with an issue 
not addressed in the documentation that is included with each 
distribution of Linux. Linux veterans who assist newcomers through the 
forum of Usenet soon become aware of the frequency with which certain 
technical questions are repeatedly posted - questions the answers to 
which are readily available in one or more of the existent online 
repositories. So, to diminish the likelihood of being "flamed" in 
response to your posted question on Usenet or irc, read further!

</para>

<para>

Armed with a browser, Linux users may rapidly become adept at 
troubleshooting their systems. The key is knowing how and where to look. 
My objective is to guide the user - particularly the Linux newbie - in 
this quest.

<title>Document history</title>
<para>

Howard Mann conceived and formulated the first version of this HOWTO. He 
kept managing and updating it until version 1.3. Maintainership was then 
taken over by Jean-Philippe Guérard, who is now in charge of this 
document.

</para>
</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="howtos">
<title>HOWTOs</title>

<para>

HOWTOs are detailed reference documents on a specific subject, usually 
following a step-by-step approach. A HOWTO is a good document to help 
you discover a task or a topic you don't know. It will provide you with 
the basic steps and the major references.

</para>

<para>

These documents are particularly useful when you decide to provide or 
access a new service with your Linux system, or when you embark on a 
technically complex project. For example, you may have the option of 
accessing the 'net with a DSL or Cable Modem service - excellent guides 
are available in the form of HOWTOs.

</para>

<para>

Authors of these documents often include references and links to sites 
that they have found useful. You may find the information you need at 
one of these hyperlinked sites rather than in the HOWTO itself.

</para>

<!-- It would be nice to find a new relevant example to put here. -->

<para>

To find HOWTOs, the first place to go is the <ulink 
url="http://www.tldp.org">Linux Documentation Project (LDP)</ulink>. The 
LDP includes a <ulink 
url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX/howtos.html">HOWTO Index 
Page</ulink> that I suggest you bookmark in your browser.

</para>

<para>

These HOWTOs are written by Linux users and are periodically updated by 
the authors. Many authors provide the latest version at a personal 
website and a hyperlink to the latter is typically provided in the 
document. This version may be newer than the one available at the LDP 
website.

</para>

<para>

Note also that other HOWTOs are available, the authors of which have not 
submitted them to the LDP. It is definitely worthwhile trying to find 
these using an Internet search engine as I describe in a subsequent 
section.

</para>

<!-- Should I suggest here to use the "HOWTO" keyword in a google 
     search?
  -->

</sect1>

<!-- Add a section about LDP guides? -->

<sect1 id="faqs">

<title>Frequently-Asked-Questions (FAQs)</title>

<para>

Users of Internet Newsgroups and Mailing lists soon discovered that some 
basic questions were being asked over and over again. To provide an 
answer to these questions, and to avoid them being repeated continually, 
FAQs were developed, listing the most classical questions and their 
agreed answers.

</para>

<para>

A list of FAQs is also a traditional accompaniment to Linux-related 
software. The FAQ is the first document to peruse when troubleshooting a 
particular application. It provides answers to typical questions, and is 
a good place to start troubleshooting a specific problem. In addition, 
FAQs exist for Linux distributions, window managers, and the so-called 
desktop environments (KDE and Gnome).

</para>

<para>

A FAQ is typically provided online by the developers of the product in 
question, and enterprising users sometimes host an 
<quote>unofficial</quote> FAQ as well. Search for the latter with an 
Internet search engine.

</para>

<para>

For Linux newbies, I provide links to two FAQs that collectively
address <emphasis>many</emphasis> of the questions posted to the Usenet
newsgroups:

FAQ</ulink>

</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="onlinesupport">


<title>Online Support Sections</title>

<para>

These sections are typically found at the websites of Linux 
distributions, and often contain a variety of helpful documents with 
information not easily encompassed within a FAQ. Look for sections with 
one or more of the following titles:

</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>
Installation Support
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Knowledge or Solutions Databases
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>

Hardware Guide or Compatibility List
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Technical Guides
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
White Papers
</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>

Some websites provide a site search engine that will facilitate your 
quest for a solution.

</para>

<para>

If you have a problem with a newly installed distribution, look here 
first as bugs and their fixes are typically posted here. You may find a 
detailed guide that will help you accomplish a task such as upgrading 
your kernel or the version of the X Window System you are using.

</para>

<para>

I have often been able to solve problems with my Linux distribution by 
looking into the bug report database, and finding that another user 
already has offered a solution to this issue.

</para>

<para>

I recommend you spend some time at the website of the distribution you 
are using, familiarizing yourself with what is available.

</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="usenet">

<title>Usenet Newsgroup Archives</title>

<para>

The ability to search for and retrieve information from archived posts 
to the linux-related (Usenet) newsgroups represents a powerful means of 
troubleshooting in Linux.

</para>

<para>

Search engines permit one to search the archives by stipulating the 
forum, keywords, authors, dates, language and combinations thereof. 
Because the number of linux-related newsgroups is large, the likelihood 
of finding useful information is high.

</para>

<para>The main web site that currently provides access to Usenet
archives using a search engine is <ulink
url="http://groups.google.com">groups.google.com</ulink>. The most 
effective way to do a search is to use its <ulink
url="http://groups.google.com/advanced_group_search">Advanced 
Groups Search page</ulink>.</para>

<para>I would like to relate a brief anecdote to demonstrate the efficacy of
this approach. The first time I attempted to build a kernel, I was presented
with this error message when I invoked a <quote>make</quote> command:</para>

<screen>make[1]: as86: Command not found make[1]: *** [bootsect.o] Error 127
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot' make: *** [zImage]
Error 2</screen>

<para>I had no idea what <emphasis>as86</emphasis> was, but I entered
it as the keyword in the <emphasis>Subject</emphasis> field of the 
Advanced Groups Search page at groups.google.com, and was presented
with a large number of posts from folks who had encountered the same
problem. Respondents had provided the reason and solution: I did not
have an assembler/linker necessary to create machine code, and the
<emphasis>bin86</emphasis> package provided it. I downloaded and
installed a RPM package of the latter and was on my way. This entire
process took about 10 minutes (I do have an ADSL connection to the 'net
!).</para>

</sect1>

  <sect1 id="searchengines">
    <title>Internet Search Engines</title>
   <para>I frequently use a Search Engine to retrieve helpful or necessary
information from the 'net. These engines catalogue pages from commercial,
personal and academic websites, as well as Mailing Lists and the like.</para>
<para>Of course, there are a large number of available Search Engines, and I
suggest you try several before giving up on a particular quest. Research has
shown that any one of them catalogues but a small portion of existent web pages.
It is worthwhile becoming very familiar with the operational details  of at
least one non-directory engine to maximize the efficiency and efficacy of your
search efforts. You probably already have a favorite - I like 
<emphasis>Google.com</emphasis>, and will discuss it in a little more
detail.</para>

<sect2 id="google">
<title>Google.com</title>

<para>This <ulink url="http://www.google.com">engine</ulink> has 
several novel features that are described in its
<ulink url="http://www.google.com/why_use.html">Why use Google.com 
page</ulink>. In particular, the engine often returns the most useful
pages first; in fact, I have often found that the first listed page
contains the information I need. Because it caches web pages, it is
relatively fast at displaying requested items. It has a so-called
<emphasis>GoogleScout (TM)</emphasis> feature, activated by clicking on 
the "similar pages" links, that provides additional relevant links with
each item returned.</para>

<para>In addition, it has a specialized <ulink
url="http://www.google.com/linux">Linux Search Engine</ulink> that I use as my
primary Internet search tool. It searches the database of linux-related pages at
Google.com further promoting search efficiency. Try it - I am confident
you will bookmark it immediately.</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="mailinglists">

<title>Mailing List Archives</title>

<para>As you might expect, there are a very large number of linux-related
Mailing Lists that enable developers and users to communicate and collaborate on
projects. These Lists cover every conceivable aspect of Linux, from the
technical arcana of kernel development to the relatively unfocused discussion of
issues at the newbie level. Subscribers to a particular Mailing List are
generally very knowledgeable in the List's topic, and detailed and useful
information is often retrievable. The communications are publically accessible
through Internet search engines and in the form of online Mailing List Archives.
You will typically see archived pages when you conduct a search using an
Internet search engine.</para>

<para>Not all Mailing Lists are associated with an online archive, but this is
increasingly the case. Similarly, not all archives have an associated search
engine.</para>

<para>Initially, try locate the Mailing List Archive you are interested in by
typing keywords and "mailing list archive" in an Internet search
engine.</para>

<para>For a listing of linux-related Mailing Lists, peruse websites such as the
<ulink url="http://www.linuxrx.com/Lists/Lists.perl">Linux Resource
Exchange</ulink> and the <ulink url="http://www.linux.org/help/lists.html">Linux
Online Mailing Lists</ulink></para>

<para>A relatively new, excellent Mailing List resource is <ulink
url="http://www.geocrawler.com">Geocrawler (The Knowledge Archive)</ulink>. This
is a continuously updated, searchable archive of a large number of Lists that
also allows one to register and subsequently post to any particular Mailing
List. Its user interface is simple and its search function delivers messages
very quickly. I highly recommend this site.</para>
<para>You may also find Mailing List archives at the following locations
:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>The website of the distribution of Linux you use.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>The website of the Window Manager or Desktop
Environment you use.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The website dedicated to the application or project in
question.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><ulink url="http://www.mail-archive.com/lists.html">The Mail

<!-- Linux MailingList Archives</ulink></para></listitem> -->

<listitem><para><ulink url="http://www.tux.org/hypermail/">Tux Mailing List
Archives</ulink></para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>This is not a complete listing of archives and you may find additional
sites with an Internet search engine. But, this should certainly get you
going.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="usersmanuals">
<title>Online User's Manuals</title>

<para>Some of the major Linux distributions, Window Managers and Desktop
Environments publish their user's manual online. If the entire manual is not
online, installation and configuration guides are typically found at the
relevant website. This also applies to major applications like the
<emphasis>Gimp</emphasis> (GNU Image Manipulation Program).</para>

<para>So, for those users who do not have the printed manual, a wealth of
installation and configuration guidance is generally available online.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="unixrefs">
<title>Online Unix References and Tutorials</title>

<para>As Linux is a Unix-like operating system, a general familiarity with
fundamental Unix concepts such as the Unix directory hierarchy and file
permissions is essential. Fortunately, there are many Unix tutorials online that
collectively cover everything a user might need to know to use Linux. I suggest
you bookmark the following as an online reference library:</para>

<para>This documentation accompanies each version of XFree86, and is
available at the <ulink url="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86 website</ulink>.
Whenever you have trouble with your X environment, peruse the notes applicable
