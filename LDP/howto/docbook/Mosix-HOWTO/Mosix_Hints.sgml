<SECT1><TITLE>Locked Processes</TITLE>
<PARA>
If for some reason you find your processes are always locked in
     your home node and you can't find the reason, you can put the
     following lines into your ~/.profile as a stop-gap measure to
     automatically enable migration:

<PROGRAMLISTING>
        if [ -x /proc/$$/lock ]; then
           echo 0 > /proc/$$/lock
        fi
</PROGRAMLISTING>

     However, you should make an effort to find out what the problems is
     - see the Mosix FAQ at <ulink url="http://www.mosix.org"><citetitle>http://www.mosix.org/</citetitle></ulink> for details.

<TITLE>Choosing your processes</TITLE>
<PARA>
You will probably want to test your setup before deciding which
     programs you want to enable migration for. For example, if you are
     running KDE2 on a slow machine and have a significantly faster
     machine has part of your Mosix cluster, you might find
     resource-hungry programs like kmail are migrated out. This is not a
     bad thing as such, however, it can lead to a brief moment when your
     writing is not displayed on the screen immediately.

<SECT1><TITLE> Java and openMosix</TITLE>
<PARA>

Green Threads JVMs, allow for migration because each Java thread is a seperate process.

Threads other than Java green thread JVMs cannot be migrated by Linux, so openMosix cannot migrate programs that use them.


If you have the source so your Java application you might be able to compile the application nativ. In this case you might be able to migrate 
your applications to another node.

However this still needs to be tested and documented.
