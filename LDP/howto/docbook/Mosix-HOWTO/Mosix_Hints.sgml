If for some reason you find your processes are always locked in
     your home node and you can't find the reason, you can put the
     following lines into your ~/.profile as a stop-gap measure to
     automatically enable migration:

<PROGRAMLISTING>
        if [ -x /proc/$$/lock ]; then
           echo 0 > /proc/$$/lock
        fi
</PROGRAMLISTING>

     However, you should make an effort to find out what the problems is
     - see the Mosix FAQ at http://www.mosix.org for details.

You will probably want to test your setup before deciding which
     programs you want to enable migration for. For example, if you are
     running KDE2 on a slow machine and have a significantly faster
     machine has part of your Mosix cluster, you might find
     resource-hungry programs like kmail are migrated out. This is not a
     bad thing as such, however, it can lead to a brief moment when your
     writing is not displayed on the screen immediately.
