<SECT1><TITLE>openMosix HOWTO</TITLE>
<PARA>
In the beginning there was Mosix, then came openMosix, in my opinion a
more interresting project. Not only from a technical viewpoint but also
given the more correct license.  I made the decision to focus this HOWTO
on  openMosix rather than on Mosix, mainly based on the fact that
openMosix has a bigger userbase. (Moshe Bar states that 
about 97% of the old Mosix
community has been  converted to openMosix. ) (20020705)
Although lots of information might be valuable to both users of Mosix and
openMosix.  I decided to mainly split the HOWTO.  The latest release of 
the Mosix HOWTO, containing info about both Mosix and OpenMosix will be 
0.20 My intention is to focus on the openMosix HOWTO, however not
neglecting the Mosix users.

<SECT1><TITLE>Introduction</TITLE>
<PARA>

  This document gives a brief description to openMosix, a software package
  that turns a network of GNU/Linux computers into a computer cluster.
  Along the way, some background to parallel processing is given, as
  well as a brief introduction to programs that make special use of
  openMosix's capabilities. The HOWTO expands on the documentation as it
  provides more background information and discusses the quirks of
  various distributions.
</PARA>
<PARA>
  Since the creation of this HOWTO some people of the Mosix team created 
openMosix (more info later) both openMosix and Mosix are being discussed 
in this HOWTO </PARA>
<PARA>

  Kris Buytaert got involved in this piece of work when Scot Stevenson was 
  looking for somebody to take over the Job, this was during February 2002
  While initially we discussed both Mosix and openMosix this version 
  of the HOWTO now mainly focusses on openMosix.  Please note that 
  the document often still mentions Mosix where it should read openMosix.

  ("FEHLT", in case you are wondering, is German for "missing"). You will 
  notice that some of the headings are not as serious as they could be. Scot 
  had planned to write the HOWTO in a slightly lighter style, as the world 
  (and even the part of the world with a burping penguin as a mascot) is 
  full of technical literature that is deadly.  Therefore some parts still 
  have these comments

   If you have a technical question about Mosix itself, please post them
   on the (Open)Mosix mailing list. Do not repeat not send them to the Scot
   who doesn't know squat about the internals, finds
   anything written in C++ terribly confusing, and learned Python mainly
   because the rat on the book cover was so cute.
