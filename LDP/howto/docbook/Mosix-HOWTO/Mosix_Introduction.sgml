  This document gives a brief description to Mosix, a software package
  that turns a network of GNU/Linux computers into a computer cluster.
  Along the way, some background to parallel processing is given, as
  well as a brief introduction to programs that make special use of
  Mosix's capabilities. The HOWTO expands on the documentation as it
  provides more background information and discusses the quirks of
  various distributions.

  Kris Buytaert got involved in this piece of work when Scot Stevenson was 
  looking for somebody to take over the Job, this was during February 2002
  The first new versions of this HOWTO are rewrites of the Mosix Howto 
  draft and the Suse Mosix HOWTO

  ("FEHLT", in case you are wondering, is German for "missing"). You will 
  notice that some of the headings are not as serious as they could be. Scot 
  had planned to write the HOWTO in a slightly lighter style, as the world 
  (and even the part of the world with a burping penguin as a mascot) is 
  full of technical literature that is deadly.  Therefore some parts still 
  have these comments

  Initially this was a draft version of a text intended to help Linux 
  users with  SuSE distributions install the Mosix cluster computer package - in
  other words, to turn networked computers running SuSE Linux into a
  Mosix cluster. This HOWTO is written on the basis of a monkey-see,
  monkey-do knowledge of Mosix, not with any deep insight into the
  workings of the system. 

</PARA>
<PARA>

  The original  text  did  not cover Mosix installations based on the
  2.4.* kernel. Note that SuSE 7.1 does not ship with the vanilla
  sources to that kernel series.

   If you have a technical question about Mosix itself, please post them
   on the Mosix mailing list. Do not repeat not send them to the Scott 
   who doesn't know squat about the internals, finds
   anything written in C++ terribly confusing, and learned Python mainly
   because the rat on the book cover was so cute.
