<TITLE>Extra Features in openMosix</TITLE>
<PARA>


As I write this in august 2002 , the first extra feature in openMosix is a 
fact,  

Louis Zechtzer implemented the first version of the auto-discovery
daemon
</para>
<para>

Version 0.0.1 supports:
<simplelist>
<member>Auto-discovery of nodes via multicast messaging.</>
<member>Aliases for hosts with multiple interfaces.</>
<member>Basic routing (in the case where true multicast routing is
  undesirable).</>
</simplelist>
