# Back up another computer's drive to this system. To make this work, we
# need a convenient chunk of disk space on this computer. This version
# uses ssh to do its transfer, and compresses using bz2. This version was
# developed so that the system to be backed up won't be authenticated to
# log onto the backup computer. This script is intended to be used on a
# firewall. You don't want the firewall to be authenticated to the backup
# system in case the firewall is cracked.

# 2004 04 03: added /sys to the list of excludes. It is a read-only
# pseudo-file system like /proc.

# 2002 07 01: We now set the path on the target to the zip drive with
# a variable. This fixes a bug in the command to eject the zip disk.

# 2002 07 01: The zip disk archives are now in bzip2 format, so this
# script has been changed to reflect that.
