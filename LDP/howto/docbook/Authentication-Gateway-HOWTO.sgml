    <para>
    There are many concerns with the security of wireless networks and
    public access areas such as libraries or dormitories. These
    concerns are not met with current security implementations. A work around
    has been proposed by using an authentication gateway. This gateway
    addresses the security concerns by forcing the user to authenticate 
    in order to use the wireless network.

  <para>
  With wireless networks and public acces areas it is very easy for 
  an unauthorized user to gain access. Unauthorized users can look 
  for a signal and grab connection information from the signal. 
  Unauthorized users can plug their machine into a public terminal and
  gain access to the network. Security has been put in place such as 
  WEP, but this security can be subverted with tools like AirSnort. 
  One approach to solving these problems is to not rely on the wireless 
  security features , and instead to place an authentication gateway in 
  front of the wireless network or public access area and force users 
  to authenticate against it before using the network. This HOWTO describes 
  how to set up this gateway with Linux.

 <sect1 id="services">
  <title>What is needed</title>

  <para>
  This section describes what is needed for the authentication gateway.
  </para>

    

  <sect2 id="netfilter">
   <title>Netfilter</title>

   
   <para>
   The authentication gateway uses Netfilter and iptables to manage the 
   firewall. Please see the 
   <ulink url="http://netfilter.samba.org/unreliable-guides/packet-filtering-HOWTO/index.html">Netfilter HOWTO</ulink>.
   </para>

   
  </sect2>



  <sect2 id="pamiptables">
   <title>PAM for Netfilter rules.</title>

   <para>
   This is a pluggable authentication module (PAM) written by Nathan Zorn that can be found 
   at <ulink url="http://www.itlab.musc.edu/~nathan/pam_iptables/">http://www.itlab.musc.edu/~nathan/pam_iptables</ulink>.
   </para>

   
  </sect2>


  <sect2 id="dhcpd">
   <title>DHCP Server</title>

   <para>
    The authentication gateway will act as the dynamic host
    configuration protocol (DHCP) server for the public network. It
    only serves those requesting DHCP services on the public
    network. I used the <ulink url="http://www.isc.org/products/DHCP/">ISC DHCP Server
    </ulink>. 
   </para>

   
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="authentication">
    <title>Authentication mechanism</title>

    <para>The gateway can use any means of PAM authentication.
    The authentication mechanism the Medical University of South
    Carolina uses is LDAP. Since LDAP was used for authentication,
    the pam modules on the gateway box were set up to use
    LDAP. More information can be found at <ulink
    url="http://www.padl.com/pam_ldap.html">http://www.padl.com/pam_ldap.html</ulink>.
    PAM allows you to use many means of authentication. Please see
    the documentation for the PAM module you would like to use. For
    more information on other methods, see <ulink url="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/modules.html">pam modules</ulink>. 
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="dnsserver">
    <title>DNS Server</title>
    
    <para>
    The gateway box also serves as a DNS server for the public
    network. I installed <ulink
    url="http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/">Bind</ulink>, and set it
    up as a caching nameserver. The rpm package
    caching-namserver was also used. This package came with Red Hat.
 </para>
 </sect2>
 </sect1>




<sect1 id="setup">
  <title>Setting up the Gateway Services</title>

    <para>
    This section describes how to setup each piece of 
    the authentication gateway. The examples used are for a private 
    public network in the 10.0.1.0 subnet. eth0 is the interface on 
    the box that is connected to the internal network. eth1 is the 
    interface connected to the public network. The IP address used
    for this interface is 10.0.1.1. These settings can be 
    changed to fit the network you are using. Red Hat 7.1 was used for 
    the gateway box, so a lot of the examples are specific to Red Hat.
    </para>

  

  <sect2 id="netfiltersetup">
   <title>Netfilter Setup</title>

    
   <para>
   To setup netfilter the kernel must be recompiled to include netfilter
   support. Please see the <ulink url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">Kernel-HOWTO</ulink> 
   for more information on configuring and compiling your kernel.

   iptables needs to be installed. To install iptables either use
   a package from your distribution or install from source. 
   Once the above options were compiled in the new kernel and iptables
   was installed, I set the following default firewall rules.
   </para>

   <screen>
   iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
   iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -m state --state NEW, INVALID -j DROP
   iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -m state --state NEW, INVALID -j DROP
   iptables -I FORWARD -o eth0 -j DROP
   iptables -I FORWARD -s 10.0.1.0/24 -d 10.0.1.1 -j ACCEPT
   </screen>

   <para>
   The above commands can also be put in an initscript to start up when
   the server restarts.
   To make sure the rules have been added issue the following
   commands:
   </para>

   <screen>
   iptables -v -t nat -L
   iptables -v -t filter -L
   </screen>
   
   <para>
   To save these rules I used Red Hat's init scripts.
   </para>
 
   <screen>
   /etc/init.d/iptables save
   /etc/init.d/iptables restart
   </screen>

   <para>
   Once the rules are in place turn on IP forwarding by
   executing this command.
   </para>

   <screen>
   echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
   </screen>

   <para>
   To make sure ip forwarding is enabled when the machine restarts
   add the following line to <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename>.
   </para>

   <screen>
   net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
   </screen>

   <para>
   Now the gateway box will be able to do network address translation
   (NAT), but it will drop all forwarding packets except those
   coming from within the public network and bound for the gateway.
   </para>   
   
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="pamiptablessetup">
   <title>PAM iptables Module</title>

   <para>
   This module is a PAM session module that inserts the firewall rule
   needed to allow forwarding for the authenticated client. To set it
