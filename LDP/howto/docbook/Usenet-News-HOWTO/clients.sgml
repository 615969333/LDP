<section><title>Usenet news clients</title>
<para>
This HOWTO was written to allow a Linux system administrator provide the
Usenet news service to readers of those articles. The rest of this HOWTO
focuses on the server-end software and systems, but one chapter
dedicated to the clients does not seem disproportionate, considering
that the <emphasis>raison d'etre</emphasis> of Usenet news servers is to serve
these clients.
</para>

<para>
The overwhelming majority of clients are software programs which access
the article database, either by reading <literal>/var/spool/news</literal> on a
Unix system or over NNTP, and allow their human users to read and post
articles. We can therefore probably term this class of programs UUA, for
Usenet User Agents, along the lines of MUA for Mail User Agents.
</para>

<para>
There are other special-purpose clients, which either pull out articles
to copy or transfer somewhere else, or for analysis, <emphasis>e.g.</emphasis> a
search engine which allows you to search a Usenet article archive, like Google
(<literal>www.google.com</literal>) does.
</para>

<para>
This chapter will discuss issues in UUA software design, and bring out
essential features and efficiency and management issues. What this
chapter will certainly <emphasis>never</emphasis> attempt to do is catalogue all
the different UUA programs available in the world --- that is best left to
specialised catalogues on the Internet.
</para>

<para>
This chapter will also briefly cover special-purpose clients which
transfer articles or do other special-purpose things with them.

We will discuss Suck and <literal>nntpxfer</literal> from the NNTP server
distribution here. Suck has already discussed earlier. We will be happy
to take contributed additions that discuss other client software.
