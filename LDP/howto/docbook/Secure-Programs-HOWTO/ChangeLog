2001-4-05  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Expanded discussion of trusted path and trustworthy channels.
	* Noted that when fixing a vulnerability, log later attempts.

2001-3-30  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added cross-references and other information noting that, at
	  installation time, you should check your system assumptions
	  necessary for security.

2001-3-22  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Noted the problem with globbing.

2001-3-20  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added reference to Halvar Flake's slides on disassembling closed
	  source programs.

2001-3-06  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added reference to http://www-syntim.inria.fr/fractales/Staff/
	  Raynal/LinuxMag/SecProg/Art4/index.html
	* Added note about rfork().

2001-2-28  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Noted that you need to load initialization values from a trusted
	  location (based on recent problems with Joe)
	* Added reference to IETF RFC 1750 (Randomness Recommendations
	  for Security).
	* Noted that Mandrake 7.1 includes libsafe.

2001-2-27  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Fixed many minor typos - thanks to John Levon who identified them.
	* Noted various security extensions, such as FreeBSD's jail(2)
	  and the huge numbers of research efforts for Linux (Janus,
	  Subterfugue, NSA Linux/Flask, RSBAC, etc.).  Sometime I'll have to
	  add the information on Trusted Solaris, etc., but for the moment
	  I refer to NSA's "Evaluated Product List" which has specific
	  information on the security approaches of some of them.
	* Noted "fuzz".
	* Added a reference to William Stalling's excellent collection
	  of papers, "Practical Cryptography for Data Internetworks."

2001-2-8  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Noted other shell special characters, in particular the whitespace
	  characters that separate parameters.

2001-1-12 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 2.75.
	* Moved from DocBook 3.0 to DocBook 3.1.  I tried doing this
	  earlier, but I forgot to change "Davenport" to "OASIS" and got
	  lots of error messages.  The right header obviously matters!
	* Added a figure ("program") showing my abstract view of programs;
	  it's not deep, but it helps to logically keep things straight.
	  The master file is "program.dia", which is editable with the
	  open source (GPL'ed) program "Dia" available at
	  http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia (and in many distributions).
	  It's not beautiful (I'm no artist), but hopefully it helps
	  explain the idea.
	* Switched to distributing a tarball, so the figure is included.
	* Modified the random number section, after 
	  Jordan Dimov <jdimov@cis.clarion.edu> rightly complained that my
	  phrase 'truly random numbers' was somewhat misleading.
	  Fair enough, I was glossing over the details (which I knew) -
	  hopefully this version gives the bigger picture.
	  I ended up basically rewriting the section.
	* Added section about "Open Source" and security.

2001-1-1 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Released the book as version 2.70.
	  Seriously extended and modified the book, adding lengthy
	  discussions about cross-site malicious content, verifying
	  HTML and URIs, and creating temporary files.
	  Did a number of clean-ups and various additions, too.

2000-12-4 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added a section, "prevent-include-access".
	I was reminded of this issue by the Bugtraq posting of 1 Dec 2000
	by Mads Bach (bach@INDER.NET), with the subject line
        "Web based apps and include files".
	* Added a section about not including comments in returned data.

2000-11-10 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added information about Java not enforcing "private" etc.
	  from null/trusted Classloaders, my thanks to
	  John Steven who noted this!
	* Added reference to sci.crypt and their FAQ.
	* Modified the definition of "Availability" due to a
	  comment by Alan Santos.
	* Fixed discussion about sprintf().. you _can_ use sprintf()
	  to avoid buffer overflows, but its use is tricky.

2000-10-30 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added a reference to the GLB Act (a new U.S. law)

2000-10-26 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added a note that you should only call to programs intended for
	  calling by another program.

2000-10-26 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Michael Kerrisk mentioned that #defining
	   _SVID_SOURCE or _BSD_SOURCE, then #include <features.h>,
	   will cause __USE_MISC to be defined (and allow clearenv).

2000-10-24 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added a discussion about vfork.  John Levon pointed me to the
	  issue, which was written up by Solar Designer.

2000-10-03 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Company name change; RST became "Cigital".

2000-09-05 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added a note about web bugs.

2000-09-03 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added a number of internal cross-references (29 currently).
	  Now that I've given all sections an "id", I can use the
	  "xref" tag effectively.  This should really help readers
	  follow the text in some places... now you can easily jump
	  to related material in the text.
	* Added "Free Software" to some titles as well as
	  "Open Source Software", and pointed to the FSF for more
	  such information.  Also fixed a typo.

2000-09-01 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Modified Conclusions and "atomic" section to emphasize the
	  problems with /tmp and /var/tmp directories (especially
	  how attackers create symbolic links in them to cause trouble).
	* Modified the SGML so that all <sectX> (as well as all chapters)
	  have a reasonable "id" attached.  Now all HTML filenames have
	  meaningful filenames, as well as the sections inside.
	  This will make it easier for people to externally link to
	  specific sections of the document.
	* Added note that glibc _does_ filter the LANG setting for
	  setuid/setgid, but that it's been buggy (Red Hat released a fix
	  on September 1, 2000).

2000-08-28 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added the note that MD5 is rumored to be broken (& referenced
	  the 22 August 2000 posting in Bugtraq that raised this).
	  I don't want to be a rumormonger, but since MD5 has already been
	  shown to be partly broken, this seems quite plausible; besides,
	  a better algorithm is available, so this is yet another reason
	  to switch.

2000-08-21 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added information that strlcpy/strlcat are being added to glib
	  (I'm the one that implemented & recommended the patch, based
	  on the original BSD work).
	* Added "id" entries for chapters - it improves HTML filenames
	  and begins to add usable internal links.

2000-07-31 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Moved filtering locale information into the "input" section,
	  since that's where it logically went.  Expanded it, since
	  many may not know about i18n.
	* Released version 2.31.

2000-07-27 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added more information about formatting strings and
	  internationalization (i18n).
	* Released version 2.30.

2000-07-23 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added in some information (and an example) from the GNOME
	  Programming guidelines.
	* Added a note and reference to Byte, April 1986, which discusses
	  some of the issues with terminal escape codes.

2000-07-18 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added warnings about formatting characters to printf()
	  and family, including %n, as well as other formatting systems
	  like syslog().  My thanks to John Levon for reminding
	  me to do this, and for reviewing my early drafts.
	* The bugtraq message about safely using sprintf with the width
	  modifier didn't sound right to me, so I double-checked it.
	  I found that in fact it is completely unsafe!
	  Not all bugtraq posters check their claims, that's for sure!
	  So, modified the text to note that this is UNsafe.
	* Modified BFBTester reference, noting that it's GPLed.  I also worked
	  with the BFBTester author to get it ported to Linux; turns out
	  a subtlety with threads made waitpid() not work the way he
	  expected (because threads are Linux processes, and an "uncle"
	  cannot wait on its "nephew").
	* Moved tools to be under "Miscellaneous", instead of C-centric;
	  many tools aren't C/C++-centric, and even those that are might
	  change later, so may as well put them in a place that they'll stay.
	  It's easier to compare tools if similar kinds are all in one place.
	* Added warnings about protecting the output of syslog().

2000-07-03 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added example of "safe" use of sprintf (length option)
	  from bugtraq posting. [but see 2000-07-18]

2000-06-29 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added reference to BFBTester.

2000-06-28 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added warning about signed char.

2000-06-22 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Expanded the section on race conditions.

2000-06-07 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added text about ITS4 and LClint. Mentioned Shmoo and made sure
	  that I had everything they did.
	* Added info from Martin Douda on other problematic shell characters.
	* Added a few nuggets on Java and C from
	  http://java.sun.com/security/seccodeguide.html
	* Added many more references to related security information.
	* Explained more about shell scripting languages &
	  why they're a problem.

2000-06-02 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added reference to the Python Restricted Environment stuff.
	  Added my own warning about only copying in references
	  (I didn't see such a warning in any material I have).

2000-05-24 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Switched to GNU Free Documentation License (FDL), which is
	  designed for documents (the GPL really wasn't).

2000-05-22 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Began adding more language-specific information, such as Perl
	  info from perlsec(1) and perlopentut(1), moving C
	  compiler flags into its own section, etc.
	* Significantly extended the Java-specific section, based on
	  the two leading Java security books.

2000-05-18 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Received several suggestions from Doug Kilpatrick: extend UTF-8
	  description, mention that the Linux kernel writers use the term
	  "task" not "process", talk more about not depending on
	  stdin/stdout/stderr being open (I mentioned it before though),
	  add "-O2" to the recommended gcc flag list (some dataflow
	  checks require this).

2000-04-25 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Minor grammar fixes.
	* Marc Welz pointed out that in Linux 2.2  you can determine the
	   pid, uid and gid using:
	   getsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_PEERCRED, &cr, &cl)

2000-04-22 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added discussion on Lucent's libsafe.
	  While writing this discussion, I sent Lucent several notes on
	  issues in libsafe. In particular, they failed to discuss in their
	  documentation the fact that depending on LD_PRELOAD
	  to enable libsafe makes it possible for evil local users to
	  disable libsafe on programs they run!  Also, I sent them
	  a list of other "dangerous" functions that they didn't cover.
	* Added more comments of "things I want to cover".  Okay, that's
 	  not the same as actually discussing them, but it's a start.

2000-04-21 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Version 2.00 released, dated 21 April 2000.  This version is
	  identical to version 1.60 in content, but switches format
	  from the Linuxdoc DTD to the DocBook DTD.
	  Thanks to Jorge Godoy for helping me perform the transition.
	  There are a few rough spots; DocBook experts are welcome to give
	  me a hand.  I now generate RTF.  The ASCII text file format is
	  quite poor; I can't help that, the tools aren't ready yet.

2000-04-04 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Version 1.60 released.
	* Changed so that it now covers BOTH Linux and Unix.  Since most
 	  of the guidelines covered both, and many/most app developers want
 	  their apps to run on both, it made sense to cover both.
	  Much of the detail still only discusses Linux, which I intend to
	  fix over time; suggestions on what to add would be great!
	* This meant adding some history about Unix (as well as Linux),
	  discussing in a few places variations (more discussion needed), etc.

2000-03-08 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* It's too long, so I changed the type from "article" to "book".
	  That meant that sect became chapt, sect1 became sect, etc.
	* Added Biblical quotations to head every chapter, for the
	  enjoyment of the reader.

2000-03-06 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added more information on using strlcpy and strlcat.
	* Expanded conclusions so it actually summarizes the key points.
	* Various minor improvements.  Well, I _hope_ they're improvements!

2000-03-05 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added a brief discussion of confidentiality, integrity, and
	  availability.  Anybody who knows about security should know about
	  this, but since it's assumed elsewhere in the text I thought it's
	  worth mentioning.
	* Added more information about signals, locking, etc.  I don't want
	  this to be a general-purpose programming primer, but some things
	  seem worth summarizing.

2000-03-03 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added reference to "Applied Cryptography" and the
	  "Linux Encryption HOWTO".
	* Added a note about ext2's reserved space for root (as a
	  preventative for denial-of-service attacks), with a reference
	  to mke2fs(8).
	* Added a new "Credits" section in the document itself to give
	  people credit.  See the ChangeLog file (this one) for the details.
	  And, responded to many suggestions, as noted below.
	* Eric S. Raymond <thanks.esr@snark.thyrsus.com> said "Nice work,
	  in general.. but I believe you have "fail open" and
	  "fail closed" reversed." Fair enough. I decided that I really meant
	  "fail safe" instead of either term, and I added a discussion
	  about that.  
	* Paul Millar <thanks.paulm@astro.gla.ac.uk> found I'd used
	   /var/log/ where I meant /var/lock/; corrected, I added
	  reference to the FHS for more information, and added some material
	  from the FHS in the hopes that people will use standard conventions
	  when they apply!
	* John Levon <thanks.moz@compsoc.man.ac.uk> suggested noting that
	  you should drop privs while parsing input, describe digest
	  passwords, mention "safer" users (like "nobody"), and mention
	  rate-limiting audit trails.  I knew about these, but I didn't
	  call them out.  So, I wrote text to cover those points.
	* A (user who prefers to be anonymous) asked how to set the
	  global environment to NULL, noting that # unset environ; set
	  or # environ='' set   don't work.  As far as I know, you need
	  to put a small "wrapper" program around sh scripts to do this,
	  so I've added that note to the document.
	* Ryan McCabe <thanks.odin@numb.org> gave a really GOOD note that
	  fixed-length strings have a built-in weakness; you can exploit
	  them by providing information around their length and cause
	  some routines to silently fail to append data.
	* Chuck Phillips <thanks.cdp@peakpeak.com> noted a more efficient
	  way to use strncpy, which I added.  He also couldn't believe
	  that strncpy NIL-filled, and sent me a long note explaining why
	  it shouldn't.  I agree that it shouldn't, but in spite of all
	  rational reasons for why it shouldn't, it DOES!  So, I added
	  references to K&R 2nd edition (page 249), and the man pages for
	  Solaris, Linux, and FreeBSD, to show that this horrible thing
	  is actually true, logic to the contrary.
	* Scott Ingram <thanks.scott@silver.jhuapl.edu> mentioned that
	  configuration is the number one problem.  I agreed, and in fact I
	  already noted that in the text, but that got me thinking that I
	  should specifically recommend making things easy to configure (as well
	  as using safe defaults).  If more programs did that, we'd have
	  a lot fewer cracked machines.
	* Martin Pool <thanks.mbp@humbug.org.au> suggested noting that
	  sometimes scripting languages can do a setenv() and affect its
	  caller.  He also suggested mentioning dynamically linked libraries,
	  but I'd already planned to do that.
	  He also suggested mentioning the ideas on breaking out of chroot
	  in http://www.suid.edu/source/breakchroot.c; I actually summarized
	  it in the text, it's just yet another example of why having root
	  privileges is enough to break out of chroot jails.
	* Chuck Phillips <thanks.cdp@peakpeak.com>,
	  Neil Brown <thanks.neilb@cse.unsw.edu.au>, and
	  Eric Werme USG <thanks.werme@alpha.zk3.dec.com> discussed NFS issues
	  with me which yielded the insight that, although NFS version 2
	  is "broken as described," version 3 _does_ support exclusive
	  file creation.  Sadly, there are still many NFS version 2 users,
	  so we can't depend on this, but the discussion did
	  suggest to me some enhancements to the text on creating locks
	  using files.


2000-02-09 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Noted that the document is now part of the Linux Documentation
	  Project (LDP).
	* Added more references, such as [Mudge 1995], [McClure 1999],
	  [Bellovin 1989], and Nathan P. Smith's
	  "Stack Smashing Security Vulnerabilities" website.

2000-01-06 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Grammo: in section "Library Solutions", s/requires/require/

2000-01-05 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 1.24; announced to http://lwn.net and
	  http://www.securityportal.com.

2000-01-05 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added information on "why did you write your own document"?
	* Added information on more per-process attributes, in particular
	  limits and the filesystem root.
	* Noted that filesystem quotas can be per-group as well as per-user.
	* Fixed a ~, which in this DTD must be written as &tilde;.
	* Fixed a few typos, thanks to review by Clyde Roby <croby@ida.org>

1999-12-30 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added some information on POSIX capabilities & the bounding set.
	* Added information explaining rwx permissions on directories.

1999-12-23 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Now at version 1.20.
	* Added major new section, section 2, that describes the Linux
	  programming model for security (e.g., file attributes, etc.).
	  I determined that there really isn't a single good place that has
	  this kind of information, and where better than to include it in
	  information on how to write secure programs?
	* Moved the "buffer overflow" section out into its own section, since
	  it's so important.  Added more information about StackGuard, etc.
	* Mentions glib in the buffer overflow section; if anyone wishes to
	  analyze the implementation to determine which glib functions protect
	  against buffer overflow I'd like to know about them.
	* Added some references to PAM.
	* Various other fixes.

1999-12-03 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Fixed minor grammar error in CGI section, added PDF format.
	* Added "favicon.ico" so Internet Explorer users, should they bookmark
	  this site, will get Tux as a logo.  Seems fair :-).

1999-11-30  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added GPL license, reference to http://www.dwheeler.com.


1999-11-29  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Initial version (1.0) completed.
