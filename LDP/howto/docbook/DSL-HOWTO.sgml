<Para>
 This document examines the DSL family of high speed Internet services now
 being deployed in various markets worldwide.  Information is included on the
 technology behind DSL as well as subscribing, installing, configuring, and
 troubleshooting, with an emphasis on how this impacts Linux users.

<Sect1 id="intro">
<Title>Introduction</Title>

<Para>
 DSL, or Digital Subscriber Loop, is a high-speed Internet access technology
 that uses a standard copper telephone line (a.k.a. 'loop' in telco parlance).
 DSL provides a direct, dedicated connection to an ISP via the existing telco
 network. DSL is designed to run on up to 80% of the telephones available in
 the United States. By using line-adaptive modulation, DSL is capable of 
 providing data speeds up to 8 Mbps.

</Para>

<Para>
 DSL services are now being aggressively marketed for home and small business
 use. DSL is typically priced below ISDN, and well below T1 service, yet can
 provide potentially even greater speeds than T1 without the
 cost, complexity, and availability issues of T1. Since DSL is a dedicated,
 often 'always on' service, it avoids the delays and use charges that are 
 common with ISDN. Making this quite a nice technology for the bandwidth
 starved masses.

</Para>

<Para>
 While all this sounds exciting, DSL does have some drawbacks. The quality of
 the DSL signal, and thus the connection, depends on distance and various
 other factors.  Also, there is no such thing as standard 'xDSL'. There are
 various flavors of DSL, and many, many ways DSL providers are implementing
 their networks. In typical fashion, Linux users are often left to fend for
 themselves, since the DSL providers are often taking the easy way out, and
 catering only to 'mainstream' Operating Systems.

</Para>

<Para>
 The topics included in this HOWTO include qualification and pre-installation,
 installation, configuration, troubleshooting and securing a DSL connection. As
 well as other related topics. There are also appendices including a
 comprehensive <Link LinkEnd="overview">DSL Overview</Link>, <link
 linkend="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</link>, a listing of <link
 linkend="links">related links</link>, and a <link
 linkend="glossary">glossary</link>. </Para>

<Para>
 Due to the fast pace of change in the telco and DSL industries, please make
 sure you have the latest version of this document. The current official
 version can always be found at <Ulink

<Sect2>
<Title>Document Structure and Reading Guidelines</Title>

<Para>
 This document attempts to give a comprehensive discussion of DSL. All aspects 
 are hopefully addressed to one degree or another with what can be a complex
 topic since it deals with networking, hardware, new fangled technologies, and 
 various approaches taken by various vendors.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 To simplify the navigation of this document, below is a suggested reading 
 guideline. Everyone should read the Introduction. Please pay special
 attention to the <Link LinkEnd="usage">Conventions and Terminology</Link>
 section, as some of this terminology may be used somewhat differently in
 other contexts. Also, there is a <Link LinkEnd="glossary">Glossary</Link> if
 you get lost in the world of TA (telco acronyms) ;-).
 
</Para>

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If you don't know anything about DSL, you should probably read the entire 
    document, with the possible exception of the 'Tuning and Troubleshooting'
    section. You may want to start with the <Link LinkEnd="overview">DSL
    Overview</Link> section in the Appendix, and then the <Link
    LinkEnd="faq">FAQ</Link>. The DSL Overview explains how the various pieces
    of the puzzle fit together. DSL network implementations are more complex
    than traditional dialup networks. 
    
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If you have already done some homework, but have not ordered service from
    anyone yet, read the <Link LinkEnd="cproviders">Choosing
    Providers</Link> section, and the <Link LinkEnd="isps">Linux Friendly
    ISPs</Link> sections. Also, you might get a head start by reading the
    <Link LinkEnd="configure">Configuring Linux</Link> section so you know
    what lies ahead.

   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If you have ordered service already, and are awaiting delivery, you can
    skip the sections on choosing a Provider. If you will be doing a
    self-install, you should read the pertinent parts of the <Link
    LinkEnd="installation">Installation</Link> section, the <Link
    LinkEnd="configure">Configuring Linux</Link> section, and the <Link
    LinkEnd="secure">Securing Your Connection</Link> section.
   
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If the installation is complete, and you can't get a working connection, 
    skip right to the <Link LinkEnd="tuning">Troubleshooting</Link> Section. 
    If you are confused by what protocols are required, or what software you 
    need to have installed, also read the <Link
    LinkEnd="configure">Configuring Linux</Link> section. If not sure what
    terms like 'sync' mean in this context, then be sure to read the <Link
    LinkEnd="overview">DSL Overview</Link> section first so you know how it
    all fits together.

<Title>New Versions</Title>

<Para>
 Version .99 addresses some of the many changes that have occurred since the
 original ADSL mini HOWTO was published. Originally, ADSL was the primary DSL
 technology being deployed, but more and more some of the other DSL flavors are
 entering the picture -- IDSL, SDSL, G.Lite, and RADSL. Thus the renaming from
 'ADSL mini HOWTO' to the 'DSL HOWTO'. There have been many other changes in
 DSL technology as well. PPPoE/A encapsulation has become more and more common
 as many ISPs are jumping on this bandwagon.

You should decide on 1, one, location to list as the home of this HOWTO.

Would prefer the dynamic dns address. But, worry about the longevity of these
services. Is there such a thing as 'pre-release version' as an alternate?

<Title>Conventions, Usage and Terminology</Title>

<Para>
 For the sake of simplicity and sanity, let's clarify some of the terminology
 that we will be using in this document, so that we are all on the same page.
 While many of the definitions below are not always 100% technically correct,
 they are close enough for our purposes here. In fast moving technologies like
 DSL, there are so many 'ifs, ands, and buts' that it is difficult to say
 anything with any degree of certainty and have it stick. And there are
 exceptions to almost every rule. And sometimes exceptions to the exceptions.
 We will be dealing with generalities to a large degree here, please keep that
 in mind.

  <Para>
   'DSL' will be used to refer to the entire family of DSL technologies now
   available  -- ADSL, SDSL, IDSL, RADSL, etc. ADSL still seems to be the most
   prevalent at this time, but the others are being deployed more and more. Where
   it is important to differentiate one type of DSL from another, the full
   proper name will be used: e.g. RADSL. xDSL also is also commonly used to
   refer to the various DSL technologies as a group, but we will be using just 
   'DSL' here.

<comment>You should clearly state which you will use in this document, either
xDSL or DSL.  The last sentence can easily be extended... , but we will be
using DSL in this document or something similar.

   The term 'telco' here refers to any potential DSL provider. This includes
   the ILECs (Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers), a.k.a. the old guard phone
   companies. And CLECs (Competitive Local Exchange Carriers), or independent
   providers such as Covad and Rhythms. Both are providing DSL services over
   existing copper lines.

<comment> The last two sentences there need a bit of work, but I wasn't sure
what to do with them.  I'll take a look again later.

Chopped out one sentence, and minor re-wording (is that a word?). HB.

   'CO' is the telco acronym for 'Central Office'. Traditionally this is a
   building where one end of your phone line physically terminates. The other
   end terminates at your home, office, or wherever. It will be used here to
   refer to the telco end termination point, regardless of whether it is a
   traditional Central Office building or another, smaller, remote structure
   or device.
  
  </Para>
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   'Loop' is telco speak for 'phone line'. Essentially, you should think of
   your loop as one dedicated pair of copper wires that run uninterrupted from
   your residence or office directly to the CO. This is perhaps an
   oversimplification, but will serve our purposes. DSL availability, and
   signal quality, is tied directly to the characteristics of your physical
   line -- or 'loop' as they say.
   
  </Para>
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   'POTS' is the acronym for Plain Old Telephone Service. In other words, 
   traditional, non-digital devices like phones and answering machines.
   
  </Para>
 </ListItem>
 
 
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   'DSLAM' is the sophisticated hardware device in the telco's CO where your 
   phone line physically terminates, and thus makes DSL happen. Increasingly,
   telcos are making use of smaller devices like the 'mini-RAM' in remote
   locations. We'll use 'DSLAM' here as a catchall for any device that enables
   DSL service from a telco.
   
  </Para>
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   'Modem' will be used to refer to the end user device that enables a DSL
   connection. Your modem is connected to the telco's DSLAM in
   the CO via your loop. When they are 'talking' DSL to each other, they are
   in 'sync'. Without 'sync', no connection to the ISP is possible. 
   
  </Para>
   
  <Para> 
   'Modem' is indeed the correct terminology since there is MOdulation and
   DEModulation of the signal. These modems typically have other features too.
   Some ISPs and manufacturers may be marketing simply 'routers', 'bridges',
   or even 'brouters' for this purpose. These are essentially DSL modems with
   enhancements. A compatible 'modem' of some kind is the minimum hardware
   requirement at the customer's end of the connection. The most commonly 
   supplied modem is actually a combination bridge and modem.

  </Para>

  <Para>
   Unless stated otherwise, we will also be assuming the 'modem' has an
   ethernet interface, and will connect to a standard Network Card (NIC). For
   right now, arguably the only workable configuration is an ethernet
   interface. And perhaps is also the only viable option based on what
   delivery systems and hardware are now being offered by the overwhelming
   number of providers. This could be changing soon however.
 
  </Para>

  <Para>
   It is worth noting that 'routers' as supplied by DSL providers are
   typically modem/router combination devices. In our context, 'router' will
   refer to these devices as such. There are also SOHO routers available that
   are only dedicated routers and lack the modem functionality. 
 
  </Para>


 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   Previous versions of this document referred to the modem as an 'ANT' (ADSL
   Network Termination). While this may be technically correct terminology, it
   is not used by ISPs, manufacturers, telcos, or most users to any extent.
   The 'modem' will be just called a modem, regardless of whatever other
   features it may have (i.e. router, bridge, etc.).

  </Para>
 </ListItem>

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
  PPPoX will be used to refer to PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet) and PPPoA
  (PPP over ATM) collectively. These protocols are being used by many DSL
  providers now.

<Sect2>
<Title>Pre-Installation</Title>

<Para>
 Beyond the obvious consideration of price, there are many reasons to
 investigate which providers may be offering DSL services in your area. The
 large Telephone companies are everywhere, and may advertise the most. But
 increasingly smaller ISPs and independents are getting into the act. This is
 creating diversity in the DSL marketplace. A good thing of course, but
 possibly creating a little confusion too. 

</Para>

<Para>
 Not all DSL services are alike. Just because two local companies are offering 
 'ADSL', does not mean that necessarily there is much in common at all. In
 fact, there are potentially a number of factors that make one ADSL provider's
 service significantly different from another's. Some things to consider:

 more on <Link LinkEnd="dslmodems">modems</Link>, 
 <Link LinkEnd="qualify">qualifying for service</Link>, and 
 <Link LinkEnd="cproviders">choosing a provider</Link>.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Once you have chosen a provider, and ordered service, the next step is for
 the telco to 'qualify' your loop. This essentially means testing your line to
 make sure it can handle the DSL signal, and possibly what level of service
 may be available to you. This may take some time, especially if the telco 
 encounters problems with the loop. If no problems are found during this
 phase, then possibly there will be a two to three week wait for the installation.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 After the telco has qualified the loop and readied their end of the
 connection, the next step is installation of the necessary components at the
 customer's end of the connection: wiring modifications, splitter or filters,
 and, of course the modem and any necessary software.

<Sect2>
<Title>Installation Options -- Self Install or Not</Title>

<Para>
 You may or may not have a choice on how the installation is done, or who
 does it. This is totally at the discretion of the provider. Many providers
 offer a 'self install' option where you do all the work. In this scenario,
 the provider will send a kit in order to save them from sending a tech, and
 thus reducing cost. Typically, self install kits will include microfilters
 for the POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) phone jacks, the modem (and maybe
 a NIC), and a CDROM with drivers, etc. on it. In some cases, a splitter may
 be included instead of microfilters. 

<comment>From what I understand (this may be completely rumor and
superstition) most of the time when a "splitter" needs to be installed
at, or near the telco's demarc, a "self install" is not an option.  A
certified telco technician may need to come install the splitter.</comment>
 
</Para>

<Para>
 The other possibility is for the provider to do the
 installation. Obviously, the cost is higher here, but it may have the
 advantage of having a trained tech do any wiring. There is also a
 better chance of getting a <quote>splitter</quote>ed installation
 with this option (a good thing!). Another benefit is that if
 something is wrong with the line, or the telco has not provisioned
 the line properly, an on-site tech may be able to help sort out some
 kinds of problems quickly.
 
<comment>Most of the technicians here in Qwest land are "pole
jockeys", who don't know anything about DSL, or about computers.  They
come out and install the line, but may not know more than "put this CD
in, click on install".</comment>

</Para>

<Para>
 The self-install kit should come with full instructions, regardless of whether
 the installation will be splittered or filtered. So we won't go into much
 detail on this aspect.

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    <Emphasis>Dedicated Line</Emphasis>. Some DSLs require a dedicated, or
    'dry', wire pair, e.g. IDSL. This means a separate line for DSL and
    Internet connectivity. Also, DSL services from CLECs (independent telcos
    like Covad or Rhythms), will use a dedicated line since the ILEC will not
    share one line with another company. (Instead the CLEC will actually lease
    a loop from the ILEC.) One your end, this simply means using one of the
    unused wire pairs in the telco wire bundle, and connecting it to the DSL

  <Para>
   <Emphasis>Shared Line with Splitter</Emphasis>. For DSLs, like ADSL, that
   are provided over the same line as regular voice service (POTS), the signal
   must be filtered somehow so that voice services are not adversely effected.
   Installing a splitter splits the line into two pairs, and filters the DSL
   signal from one of them. This results in a inside wiring scheme where DSL
   goes to only one jack, and then POTS service to all other jacks. This is
   considered by many to be a better type of installation than 'splitterless'. 
  
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   Splitters are available from various manufacturers and come in various
   shapes and sizes. Some are small enough to fit in the NID itself (sometimes
   called 'SNI', this is the telco phone box on the outside of your house),
   while others have a housing as large as the NID itself. Typically this is
   mounted near the NID, on the customer's side of the demarcation point.

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   <Emphasis>Shared Line with Filters</Emphasis>. Again, for DSLs that
   piggyback on the POTS line, the signal must be filtered or split at some
   point. The other way of doing this is by placing RJ11 'microfilters' in
   each phone jack -- <Emphasis>except where the DSL modem will be</Emphasis>.
   These filters are relatively small, plug-in devices and remove the higher
   frequencies associated with DSL. This is obviously much easier since no
   tools or wiring is required. This is often what is included in self-install
   kits, and is often referred to as a 'splitterless' installation.
  
  </Para>
 </ListItem> 

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   <Emphasis>Shared Line, Splitterless and Filterless</Emphasis>. Newer DSLs,
   like G.Lite, have no adverse effect on regular POTS devices and thus
   require no filters or splitters. This would seem to be the wave of the
   future. Just plug and play.

 If you are not doing the self-install option, then you may skip this section

 procedures are meant to illustrate the wiring process. Please note that your
 procedures may be different at your location.  Make sure you follow any
 warnings or safety instructions provided, that you RTFM, and that you are
 familiar with telco wiring procedures.
</Para>

<Para>
 The first step will be to wire up the connections from your provider. Identify
 the line on which service will be installed, and the locations of your
 splitter and DSL jack(s). (For perhaps a better wiring scheme, see the 
 Homerun section immediately below.)
</Para>

<Para>
 Be aware that typical telco wire has more than one pair per bundle. Often,
 two pairs, but sometimes more. If you have but one phone line, the other
 pair(s) are unused. This makes them available for use with wiring for DSL.
 Wire pairs are color coded for easy identification. SDSL and IDSL require a
 dedicated, or 'dry', pair. If an unused pair is available, then no real
 re-wiring is required. It is just a matter of re-wiring an existing jack for
 the correct pair of wires, and attaching the modem.

<Para>
 Perhaps a somewhat better method of wiring for the DSL modem is sometimes
 called a 'homerun'. It is called this because it is one, straight shot from
 the splitter to the modem's DSL jack. What this does is bypass the existing
 inside wiring altogether, and any problems that might be lurking there --
 like a corroded connection somewhere on a POTS jack. Inside wiring defects
 can be a source of headaches, especially in older homes. 
</Para> 
 
<Para> It also allows you to route the cable to avoid any potential
 RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) sources. RFI anywhere in the
 circuit can be a DSL killer. Routing the cable away from items that
 may have electric motors, transformers, power supplies, high
 intensity lighting fixtures, dimmer switches and such, is a smart way
 to go. And you are also less likely to have a failing microfilter
 cause problems. You can also use a better grade of cable such as CAT
 5 or shielded twisted pair wire.

</Para>

<Para>
 If you are splitterless (i.e. using microfilters) now, this will entail
 purchasing a splitter, and, of course, some rewiring. Microfilters also add
 distance to the effective loop length -- as much as 700 ft per filter in some
 cases! So if you have several of these, and your sync rate or distance is
 marginal, eliminating the filters may result in a significant
 improvement.

<Title>Wire the Splitter</Title>

<Para>
 If you have the splitterless design or a dedicated line, you may skip this part.
</Para>

<Para>
 The splitter will typically consist of two parts, the splitter and a small
 outdoor housing.  Mount the splitter and accompanying housing per the telco's
 instructions at the Subscriber Network Interface (SNI) point (also sometimes
 called the NID or ONI), usually the side of your house where the phone line
 is located. Put it on your side of the SNI or NID. The phone company may need
 to access the splitter for maintenance, so its advisable to locate it on the
 outside where they can get at it, but outside is not absolutely
 necessary.

<comment>Which term are you going to use?  SNI, NID, demarc,
ONI?</comment>

</Para> 
 
<Para> 
 The wire bundle should have at least two separate wire pairs. The splitter
 takes one pair, and separates the signal onto two pairs. One pair in the
 bundle will then go to all POTS jacks, and the other to the modem's DSL wall
 jack. So connect the incoming telco line to the LINE side of the splitter.
 Then wire the inside pair for your telephone to the VOICE, and your inside
 wire pair for the modem to DATA. 

</Para>


<Para>
 <Emphasis remap="bf">Checkstep </Emphasis> At this point, you should be able
 to pull dial tone off the voice side of the splitter. If this doesn't work,
 then you've wired it wrong. You can also plug the modem into the test jack in
 the SNI/NID box (most should have this). Plug in the modem's power cord, and
 if the line is provisioned correctly, you should 'sync' in less than a
 minute.  This test only requires the modem.  (Internal and USB modems
 probably will require a driver to be loaded before syncing. This means having
 the computer there too.)

<Para>
 To install, connect the modem's (or modem/router's) power cord, and connect
 the phone line between the DSL wall jack and the modem. This cable should be
 provided. If not, a regular phone cord will suffice. With the ethernet
 interfaced modems, you may also connect the ethernet cable between the NIC
 and the modem (but not really necessary at this point just to verify the
 modem is working).

</Para>

<Para>
 <Emphasis remap="bf">Checkstep </Emphasis> At this point, verify that
 the modem syncs with the telco's DSLAM signal. Most modems have a
 green LED that lights up when the signal is good, and red or orange
 if not in sync. The modem's manual will have more details on the
 LEDs. If it doesn't sync, then check your wiring, or make sure that
 the DSL signal is being sent. Do this by calling your telco and
 verifying they have activated the service. Or by testing the modem at
 the test jack on the SNI/NID (see above). Note that having dial tone
 on the line does NOT confirm the presence of the DSL data signal. And
 vice versa -- perfectly possible to have dial tone and no DSL, or DSL
 and no dial tone. There should also be no static or noise on the
 voice line when everything is installed and functioning properly.

<Title>Bridged vs PPPoX Networks</Title>

<Para>
 Before we get too far into the final stages of installing and
 configuring our system, let's look at how various DSL ISPs set up
 their networks. It will be very important for you know how your ISP
 does this, as there is more than one possibility and the steps
 involved are quite different for each. This may not be the kind of
 thing the ISP is advertising, and since you are not using Windows,
 you may not have access to the setup disk that the ISP provides. If
 you're not sure, ask the ISP's tech support staff, or other users.

</Para>

<Para>
 To muddy the waters even more, some ISPs may be offering more than one kind
 of service (over and above the various bit rate plans). Example: Bell
 Atlantic originally offered static IPs with a Bridged connection. Now all new
 installs use PPPoE with dynamic IPs. For installation and configuration
 purposes, this is very different.

</Para>

<Para>
 The two most common DSL network implementations are Bridged/DHCP and PPPoX.
 Both have mechanisms for obtaining an IP address and other related networking
 configuration details so we shouldn't have to worry about this. Our job will
 be finding the right client, and doing what we have to, to get it up and
 running.
 
</Para>


<Para>
 <Emphasis>Important!</Emphasis> You need to know beforehand how your ISP is
 setup for connecting to his network. To re-iterate, the two main
 possibilities are Bridged/DHCP and PPPoE. These are mutually exclusive
 implementations. So you will need either one or the other, and it must be the
 right one or you will waste a lot of time and effort. You cannot choose which
 one either. It is a matter of how the ISP is doing his network. Note that
 PPPoE can run over Bridged networks, so just knowing whether you are Bridged
 or not, is not necessarily good enough. PPPoA is yet another alternative. If
 your provider is giving you a router, there is a good chance that the
 router's firmware will handle all of this for you. 
 
</Para>




<!--   ~~~~~       New Section      ~~~~~     -->
<Sect3>
<Title>Bridged/DHCP</Title>

<Para>
 In the good old days of a year or two ago, 'Bridged' connections were the 
 norm. This type of network puts you on a local subnet just like a big
 LAN. You are exposed to much of the local subnet traffic, especially ARP and
 broadcast traffic. The typical means of authenticating in this set up, is via
 DHCP. 
</Para

<Para>
 DHCP is a standard, established networking protocol for obtaining an IP
 address and other important network parameters (e.g.  nameservers). This is a
 standard, well documented networking scheme and is very easy to set up
 from the end user's perspective. It is also a very stable connection. You
 can actually unplug the modem for say 10 minutes, plug it back in, let it
 re-sync, and the connection is still there -- same IP and everything. 

</Para>

</Sect3>

<!--  ~  End Section  ~  -->



<!--   ~~~~~       New Section      ~~~~~     -->

<Sect3>
<Title>PPPoX</Title>

<Para>
 The main alternative now is PPPoX, meaning either PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet)
 or PPPoA (PPP over ATM). Both of these related protocols are currently being
 deployed, but at the moment, PPPoE seems to be the more common of the two.
 PPPoX is a relative newcomer, and, as the name implies, is a variation of
 Point-to-Point Protocol that has been adapted specifically for DSL providers.
</Para>

<Para>
 There are several PPPoE clients for Linux (<Link LinkEnd="pppoe">see
 below</Link>). At this moment, PPPoA support is in beta, but should be
 available very soon. PPPoX simulates a dialup type environment. The user is
 authenticated by user id and password which is passed to a RADIUS server,
 just like good ol' dialup PPP. A routable IP address, and other related
 information, is returned to the client. Of course, no actual dialing takes
 place. The mechanics of how this is handled, will vary from client to client,
 so best to RTFM closely. Typically you will set up configuration files like
 <Filename>pap-secrets</FileName>, etc.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 From the ISPs perspective, PPP is much easier to maintain and troubleshoot.
 From the end user's perspective, it is more work to set up, uses more CPU,
 and the connection is maybe not as stable. So anyway, this seems to be the
 coming trend. Many of the large telcos, especially the RBOCs (Baby Bells),
 have committed to PPPoX already. Setting up a PPPoX connection is completely
 different from setting up a bridged/DHCP connection.

<!--   ~~~~~       New Section      ~~~~~     -->

<Sect3>
<Title>ATM</Title>

<Para>
 Since the traffic on the wire from the DSLAM to the modem is ATM, a
 raw ATM connection would seem to make sense. While possible, this is
 rare, if it exists at all in the U.S, and would require a modem in
 addition to a PCI ATM card, such as the Efficient Networks
 3010. There is an ATM project for Linux, that is being incorporated
 into the 2.4 kernel. (See the <Link LinkEnd="links">Links

<Title>Configuring the WAN Interface</Title>

<Para>
 The most common configuration is a DSL modem in 'bridging' mode. Both PPPoX
 and DHCP can use this setup. In this scenario, the WAN interface typically
 means your NIC. This is where your system meets the outside world. (If you
 have a router see <Link LinkEnd="router">below</Link> for router specific
 instructions.) So essentially we will be configuring the NIC, typically
 'eth0' since it is an ethernet interface. 
</Para> 
 
<Para>
 With PPPoX, once the connection comes up, there will be a 'ppp0', or similar,
 interface, just like dialup. This will become the WAN interface once
 the connection to the PPP server is up, but for configuration purposes we
 will we be concerned with 'eth0' initially.

<Title>Bridged/DHCP Configuration</Title>

<Para>
 ISPs that have Bridged networks typically use DHCP to assign an IP addresses,
 and authenticate the user. All distributions come with one or more DHCP
 clients. <Command>dhcpcd</Command> seems to be the most common.
 <Command>pump</Command> comes with Redhat based distributions as of Redhat
 6.0. The DHCP client will obtain an IP 'lease' from the ISP's server as well as
 other related information: gateway address, DNS servers, and network mask.
 The lease will be 'renewed' at regular intervals according to the ISP's
 configuration. 

</Para>

<Para>
 You will want the DHCP client started on boot, so use your distribution's
 means of doing this. There generally is little to configure with DHCP as it
 is fairly straightforward and easy to use. You may need to tell it which
 interface to listen on if the NIC is something other than 'eth0'. You can
 also start it from the command line to get started. See the respective man
 pages for more. 
  
</Para>

<Para>
 Unless you have a static IP, the ISP will need some way to know who you are
 when you connect. There are two ways this authentication process is
 accomplished with DHCP. The first and most common method is via the MAC (or
 hardware) address of the network device. Typically this would be the NIC. The
 MAC address is a unique identifier and can be found among the boot messages,
 or with <Command>ifconfig</Command>, and looks something like 
 <Literal>00:50:04:C2:19:BC</Literal>.  You will need to give the ISP the MAC
 address before your first connection. 
</Para> 
 
<Para> 
 The other DHCP authentication method is via an assigned hostname. In this
 case, the ISP will have provided you with this information. Your DHCP client
 will need to pass this information to the server in order for you to connect. 
 Both <Command>dhcpcd</Command> and <Command>pump</Command> accept the '-h'
 command line option for this purpose. See the client's man page, or your
 distribution's documentation, for specifics.

</Para>

    <comment>Warning/note perhaps?</comment>

<Para>
 <Emphasis>Caution!</Emphasis> If your ISP uses MAC address authentication,
 and you change your network device (e.g. NIC), you will need to register the
 new address with the ISP or you won't be able to connect.

 PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet) is an alternate way for ISPs to control your

<Para>
 <Emphasis>Warning</Emphasis>! For PPPoX, the correct setting for the ppp0
 interface MTU is 1492. If the MTU is set too high, it may cause failure of
 some web pages to load properly, and possibly other annoying problems. You
 may need to also set the MTU for interfaces on any masqueraded LAN
 connections MTU to 1452. 
 
<!--

8. Configure LAN Hosts

If you have a LAN behind the firewall, you have to lower the TCP
maximum segment size from the normal 1460 to 1452 (or better, 1412.)
You have two options: Either set the MTU of all the interfaces on
other hosts on the LAN to 1452, or use the "-m 1412" option to pppoe.
The "-m" option for pppoe is far simpler and makes it easier to add
hosts to the LAN, but consumes some extra CPU time.

If you want to manually configure the LAN hosts, here's how:

In Linux, use: "ifconfig eth0 mtu 1452".  For best results, put this
in an /etc/rc.d/rc.local script.

For Windows, machines, see http://lan.cns.ksu.edu/OS/WIN95/slip95.htm.
Set the MaxMTU to 1452.

==
E) pppoe dies with the log message "Message too long"

You set the MTU of the Ethernet interface connected to the ADSL modem
to less than 1500.  Don't do that.
-->
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Actually, for PPPoE the real setting should be at least 8 bytes less than any
 interface between you and the ultimate destination. All routers normally
 would be set to 1500, thus 1492 is correct from your end. But, it may happen
 that somewhere a router is misconfigured at a lower setting, and this can
 cause problems, especially with web pages loading. The way to test this is to
 keep dropping the MTU until things work.

<Sect3 id="pppoa">
<Title>PPPoA</Title>

<Para>
 PPPoA (PPP over ATM) is a cleaner solution than PPPoE since most of the work
 is done in hardware, and since the raw DSL traffic is ATM. There is no client
 necessary to manage the connection as with PPPoE. Authentication is still the
 same: user id and password to connect, but the mechanics are different since
 no ethernet encapsulation takes place.

</Para>

<Para>
 As of this moment, there is not really a viable, working implementation of
 PPPoA for Linux. There is an ATM patch for 2.2 kernels, support for ATM in
 the 2.4.x kernel, and a project based on the Efficient Networks 3010
 [possibly out of production], as well as other ATM cards. The ATM on Linux
 homepage is here: <Ulink URL="http://lrcwww.epfl.ch/linux-atm/">
 http://lrcwww.epfl.ch/linux-atm/</Ulink>. And even more info is at <Ulink
 URL="http://www.sfgoth.com/~mitch/linux/atm/pppoatm/">
 http://www.sfgoth.com/~mitch/linux/atm/pppoatm/</Ulink> from the kernel
 developer of this project. Existing PPPoA implementations are hardware/driver
 based, and Linux PPPoA modem drivers are scarce as hen's teeth at this time.
 The above modem does not seem to be available through normal retail channels.
 This may be a problem, if this is the only protocol an ISP delivers. At
 the very least, some rather serious hoop jumping is in order. 

</Para>

<Para>
 If PPPoA is your ISP's only option, you should probably consider one of the
 router/modems that can handle PPPoA, and let the hardware handle everything.
 
</Para>

    <comment>clearly a good place to use the "note" tag</comment>

<Para>
 <Emphasis>Note:</Emphasis> There is apparently a PPPoA beta program underway
 based on the Efficient Networks SpeedStream 3060/3061 (PCI, DMT). Efficient is
 working with kernel developers, and reportedly this program is in late beta
 at this time. The initial release will be binary only drivers, but open
 source may follow. This is a big improvement!

<Sect3 id="router">
<Title>Modem/Router Configuration</Title>

<Para>
 Some ISPs are providing 'routers' as the connection device. Essentially these
 are mini routers with built in modems. These are all ethernet based devices
 too, so Linux should be good to go here as well. Again, a compatible NIC
 should be all that is required to make this work.

</Para>
 
<Para> 
 A 'router' has many advantages. The better ones can handle the connection
 management, IP encapsulation, and authentication, as well as providing a
 means of segregating your LAN from outside traffic, and possibly other
 features too. In short they can do it all. One big advantage is that they can
 handle whatever protocols your ISP requires in order to connect. 
</Para> 
 
<Para>
 If the ISP is requiring PPPoX, then this makes life a little easier since you
 will not have to install or configure any additional software just to use
 their network. The modem's firmware will handle this. The downside is that
 most of these do not have the flexibility of a Linux router, or other
 software solution. Of course, you could set up a Linux router behind the
 router, and have the best of both worlds. The ones with more and better
 features are also going to cost significantly more.

</Para>

<Para>
 While the physical installation of a router is very similar to the modem
 installation (see above), the router configuration itself is different
 since your first 'hop' will be the router's interface and not the ISP's
 gateway. Routers will actually have two interfaces -- one that you
 connect to from the LAN side, and one that connects to your ISP on the WAN
 side. Your point of exposure here is the WAN interface of the router. 
</Para>

<Para> 
 The router will also have a pre-configured, private IP address that you will
 connect to from the LAN side. This will be your gateway. The public IP
 address will be assigned to the WAN side interface. Typically these devices
 also act as DHCP servers for the LAN side as well. So possibly all you have
 to do is to start a DHCP client such as <Command>dhcpcd</Command> or
 <Command>pump</Command> (Redhat based distros) to get up and running. Just
 make sure the modem/router is syncing first. The appropriate steps and
 configuration should be in the owner's manual, or available from your
 provider. 

<comment>which provider?</comment>

</Para>

<Para>
 If you are a PPPoX customer, and the router is handling this part of the
 connection, then you will have to configure at least your user id and
 password before connecting. If a Bridged/DHCP customer, you should just have
 to activate DHCP on the router, and possibly register the MAC (hardware
 address) of the router with your provider. Some routers have 'MAC cloning'
 which means that they will report the MAC address of the attached NIC. If
 static IP, then you will have to configure this as well.

</Para>

<Para>
 If you need to access the router directly, you will need to know the
 manufacturer's default setting for its IP address. See the owner's manual, or
 ask your provider. You will then have to set your NIC's interface to the same
 network as the router. For instance, if the router has an IP of 10.0.0.1, set
 your interface's address to 10.0.0.2 (typically eth0), and netmask to
 255.0.0.0. 

</Para>


<Screen>

 # ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.2 up netmask 255.0.0.0
 # route add -net 10.0.0.0
 $ ping 10.0.0.1

</Screen>
 
<Para> 
 If everything is in working order, the router should respond to pings. How to
 configure this permanently will vary from distro to distro. So check your
 distribution's documentation. Now you should be able to ping the
 modem/router, and, if all is well, beyond. Then use telnet or a web browser
 to do any further configuration of the router.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Even if the ISP is not offering any router options, there are quite a few
 available from third party manufacturers such as Netgear, Linksys, Cisco,
 Zyxel, Cayman, Alcatel and others. These will have all the features already
 mentioned and maybe more. Just make sure it matches your provider's DSL. This
 is one good way around the PPPoX bugaboo.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 <Emphasis>Warning!</Emphasis> Some manufacturers may be marketing these as
 having 'firewall' capabilities. In some cases, this amounts to nothing more
 than basic NAT (Network Address Translation or masquerading). Not a full,
 true firewall by any means. Be sure to read the fine print before buying and
 make sure you know how much real firewalling is included.

<Title>Which Ports?</Title>

<Para>
 There are plenty of references around on how to setup firewalls with
 <Command>ipfwadm</Command> or <Command>ipchains</Command>, but a little
 harder to find just which ports <Emphasis>really need</Emphasis> to be open.
 If you are not sure of the answer to this question, then the answer is 'as
 few as possible'! Basic rule #1, your computer cannot be broken into through
 a port that is not open. A port can't be open if nothing is listening on
 that port. In other words, if no service or daemon is running that uses that
 port, the port is closed and inaccessible.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 There are 65,536 ports available for use on Linux and these fall into
 several categories. The ones we are most concerned about are the
 'privileged' ports, which are those below port 1024. This is where
 most public services run, like SMTP on port 25, HTTP on port 80,
 named on port 53, etc. These services are where most vulnerabilities
 are on Linux. These are the ports that servers accept outside
 connections on. If you are running the <Command>telnetd</Command>
 daemon, it will 'listen' for connections on port 23. (Actually if
 spawned by <Command>inetd</Command>, it may be
 <Command>inetd</Command> that is listening.)
 
</Para>

<Para> 
 But, if you want to use a telnet <Emphasis>client</Emphasis> to
 connect to someone else's telnet server, you do not need to be running the
 <Command>telnetd</Command> daemon on your own system. You just need to start
 the client program named '<Command>telnet</Command>' (different animal). Same
 is true for ftp and other services. These daemons only need to be run for
 excepting connections to your system from an outside source.

   <comment>I don't think that the telnet command needs to be set off
   both by quotes, and by the command markup.</comment>

 Unless you have a good reason for doing so, and know what you are doing, then
 you should not be running these <comment>which?</comment> services. In fact, you could probably survive
 quite nicely with all TCP and UDP ports below 1024 closed down, or at least
 not visible to outside connections (i.e. blocked via a firewall). A couple of
 exceptions: 
</Para>

<Para>
 It is relatively safe, and probably reasonably safe, to run
 <Command>identd</Command> (port 113). Many mail and irc servers aren't happy
 without <Command>identd</Command> there. This is the one good exception to
 the 'nothing below 1024' rule of thumb. Newer versions are relatively
 secure, but be sure that you have the newest version available.
</Para>

   <comment>both relatively safe and reasonably safe?</comment>

<Para>
 Mail is a little more complicated. The only reason to have a publicly
 accessible SMTP (port 25) server is if you are hosting your own mail server
 and receiving direct incoming mail connections. If you are retrieving mail
 via POP3 from your ISP, this port does not need to be open to the world. Such
 mail does not come in via port 25. It comes in through a higher, randomly
 assigned port. 

</Para>
 
<Para> 
 But -- it may still be convenient to have a mail daemon like sendmail, qmail,
 or postfix running to handle local mail delivery. In fact, this is a common
 default set up. You can get around this by firewalling off SMTP (port 25)
 from the outside world, or using another method to sort and deliver local
 mail. One way is to use procmail in conjunction with fetchmail:
 '<Literal>fetchmail -m /usr/bin/procmail -d hal</Literal>' will do this
 without having to run sendmail or other mail daemons in daemon mode. These
 programs are still capable of sending mail in non-daemon mode.

</Para>

<Para>
 It is probably safe to run a web server if you want to. Most vulnerabilities
 there are through CGI. Just keep the web server package updated.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 OK, enough exceptions. Shut down, or firewall off, <Emphasis>everything
 else</Emphasis> below port 1024.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Those ports above 1023 are known as 'non-privileged' ports. These are mostly
 used for return connections that you have initiated to someone else's server.
 For instance, if you telnet to someone else, you connect to their port 23.
 The return data comes back to you on a randomly assigned port above 1023.
 These are mostly safe, and should as a rule be left alone. The only
 exceptions are where there are indeed services running on these ports. X
 Windows runs on ports 6000-6009 for instance. If you are running a font
 server, it may be on port 7100. Any servers running on these non-privileged
 ports, should be firewalled too.

<Title>inetd</Title>

<Para>
 Let's take a quick look at <Command>inetd</Command>, since it starts many
 services. <Command>Inetd</Command> is a 'super' daemon. It is called this
 because it controls the starting of other daemons. Telnet, ftp, rsh, identd
 and pop3 are some of the server daemons commonly controlled by
 <Command>inetd</Command>. You may not see <Command>telnetd</Command> running
 when you use <Command>ps</Command> or <Command>netstat</Command> unless
 <Command>inetd</Command> is configured to start <Command>telnetd</Command>,
 <Emphasis>and</Emphasis> someone is actually connected to
 <Command>telnetd</Command> at the time. So it may not be so obvious which of
 these servers can be accessed from outside. These sub-services are controlled
 by the configuration file <Filename>/etc/inetd.conf</FileName>. Open this
 with your favorite text editor, and put a '#' character in front of any
 service you don't want running. A brief excerpt:

<Title>Performance Tuning and Troubleshooting</Title>

  <comment>Since there are no performance tweaks, why even mention
  it?</comment>

<Para>
 There really are no tweaks, or performance tuning tricks that are likely to
 increase your performance to any significant degree -- all other things being
 equal. Windows 9x users often get a big boost by increasing their TCP Receive
 Window. But this is because it is too small to start with. This is not the
 case with Linux. 

</Para> 
 
<Para> 
 The only exception is if you have to routinely deal with a high latency
 connection. Such as maybe your provider has a satellite uplink that is
 consistently adding unusual latency (250ms or greater?). Then maybe a larger
 window will help. For the overwhelming majority of us, this is not necessary.
 For more on TCP Receive Window and related issues, look at <Ulink
 URL="http://www.psc.edu/networking/perf_tune.html">http://www.psc.edu/networking/perf_tune.html</Ulink>. 

</Para>

<Para>
 If your connection is not performing up to what you think it should be, then
 possibly there is a problem somewhere. This is more worth looking into than
 any magical 'tweak'.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 A very rough guideline on what you might reasonably expect as a maximum, based
 on distance from CO: 

</Para>

<LiteralLayout>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;0-12 Kft - 1500 Kbps or more
  12-16 Kft - 1500 Kbps -&gt; 1000 Kbps
  16-18 Kft - 1200 Kbps -&gt;  512 Kbps
  18-?? Kft - &nbsp;&nbsp;512 Kbps -&gt;  &nbsp;128 Kbps or less :(
</LiteralLayout>

<Para>
 Remember too that you will loose 10-20% of throughput to networking overhead.
 So a 1500 Kbps connection, is only going to realize about 1200-1300 Kbps or
 so of real world throughput. No tweaking is going to change this. And
 remember that if your service is capped at a lesser speed by your provider,
 then you can't get above that speed no matter what. <Emphasis>AND</Emphasis>
 -- that there are numerous variables that can effect your loop/signal
 quality, and subsequently your speed. Most of these are out of your control.

<Title>Sync Problems</Title>

<Para>
 Read this section if you have had a working connection, but now have lost
 sync, are intermittently losing sync, your sync rate has dropped
 significantly, or are getting a 'sync/no surf' condition. (Better quality
 modems will have a way to report sync rate, usually via telnet or a web
 browser interface. See the owner's manual.)
 
</Para>

<Para>
 A loss of sync indicates a problem with the DSLAM, your line (inside or
 outside) or your modem. DSLAMs typically have 'shelves' with 'cards'. Alcatel
 DSLAM cards, just for instance, have a capacity of four connections each. If
 the card goes bad, at most four customers are effected. The point being that
 sync loss outages can be very isolated. Unlike network outages that tend to
 effect large numbers of users. Sync outages are a telco problem, not an
 ISP problem. If your service agreement is with the ISP, you will need to
 contact them, who will in turn contact the telco.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Degraded sync rates, and disruption of the DSL signal, can cause various
 problems. Obviously, you will never get your maximum throughput under these
 conditions. But, the symptoms are not always obvious as to whether the
 problem is on your end or the provider's. 
 
</Para> 
 
<Para> For instance, a poor inside wire connection may result in
 retransmissions of packets that have been lost, or dropped. This can
 drasticly reduce throughput. It is tempting to think of lost packets
 as a traditional networking problem, but with DSL it is possible to
 be the result of a bad line, impaired signal, or even the modem
 itself.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Some things to try:
 
 <ItemizedList>

 <ListItem> 
  <Para>
   Power cycle the modem. Turn off the power button/switch, and physically
   unplug the cable to the wall jack for 30 seconds or so. Turn back on, and
   re-attach to wall jack. This will force a resync. Unfortunately, the only
   way to power down a PCI modem, is to reboot. This should fix a 'sync/no
   surf' condition that is caused by the modem, and maybe other conditions
   too. 
   
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 
 

  <ListItem> 
   <Para>
  
   See the <Link LinkEnd="nosync">above section</Link> on moving the modem
   lock, stock and barrel to the NID/SNI and thus bypassing all inside wiring.
   If the situation is improved there, then the problem is inside somewhere. If
   not, it is a telco problem.
 
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 


 <ListItem> 
  <Para>
   RFI Bear-hunt: The DSL signal is fragile, there are a number of
   things that can degrade it.  RFI, or Radio Frequency Interference,
   from sources in and around the home/office is one common source of
   reduced signal strength, and/or intermittent sync loss and/or low
   sync rates. Our test tool here is simply a portable AM radio. Tune
   it to any channel where you can get clear reception -- it makes no
   difference where. The AM radio will pick up RFI that is in the same
   frequency range as the DSL signal. It will sound like 'frying
   bacon' type static. Put it against your computer's power
   supply. You should hear some static. Move it away and the static
   should fade pretty quickly. This will give you an idea of what RFI
   sounds like. A decent quality power supply should produce only weak
   RFI -- probably not enough to cause a problem. Use the radio like a
   Geiger counter and move it around your modem and DSL line. If you
   hear static, follow it to the source.  Things to be suspicious of:
   power supplies, transformers, ballasts, electric motors, dimmer
   switches, high intensity lighting. Moving the modem, or rerouting
   cables is sometimes enough. Keeping the line between the modem and
   the wall jack as short as possible is a good idea too.
 
   </Para>
  </ListItem>

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    Chronic sync problems are often due to a line problem somewhere.
    Sometimes it is something as simple as a bad splice, and easily remedied
    if it can be found. Most such conditions can be isolated by a good telco
    tech. Check with your provider, and politely harass them if you have to. If you
    get the run-around, ask to go over their heads.
   
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    If you are near the distance limits of DSL, and having off and on sync
    problems, try the 'homerun' installation. See <Link
    LinkEnd="homerun">above</Link>. This can be effective in improving
    marginal signal/sync conditions.
   
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
     If using a surge protector, try it without the surge protector. Some may
     interfere with the DSL signal.
  
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 

 </ItemizedList>
</Para>

<Para>
 Another possibility is a nearby AM radio station, or bandit ham radio
 operator that are disrupting the DSL signal since they operate in a similar 
 frequency range. These may only cause problems at certain times of day, like
 when the station boosts its signal at night. A good telco DSL tech may be
 able to help minimize the impact of this. YMMV.

<Title>Network and Throughput Problems</Title>

<Para>
 Read this section if your connection is up, but are having throughput
 problems. In other words, your speed isn't what it should be based on your
 bit rate plan, and your distance from the CO. 'Network' here is the WAN --
 the ISP's gateway and local subnet/backbone, etc. Remember that a
 marginal line can cause a reduced sync rate, and this will impact throughput.
 See <Link LinkEnd="synctr">above</Link>.

</Para>

<Para>
 The two factors we will be looking for are 'latency' and 'packet loss'. Both
 are pretty easy to track down with the standard networking tools
 <Command>ping</Command> and <Command>traceroute</Command>. If either of these
 occur in our path, they will impact performance. Latency means
 'responsiveness' or 'lag time'. Actually what we are interested in is
 abnormally high latency, since there is always some latency. Packet loss is
 when a packet of data gets dropped somewhere along the way. TCP/IP will know
 it's been 'lost', and there will be a retransmission of the lost data. Enough
 of this can really slow things down. Ideally packet loss should be 0%. 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 What we really need to be concerned about is that part of the WAN
 route that we routinely traverse. If you do a traceroute to several different
 sites, you will probably see that the first few 'hops' tend to be the
 same. These are your ISP's local backbone, and your ISP's upstream provider's
 gateway. Any problem with any of this, and it will effect everywhere you go
 and everything you do. 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 We can start looking for packet loss and latency by pinging two or three
 different sites, hopefully in at least a couple of different directions. We
 will be looking for packet loss and/or unusually high latency.

 High packet loss at 35%, and some really slow roundtrip times in there as
 well. A little digging on this showed that it was a backbone router 13 hops 
 into the traceroute that was the problem. While making this site really slow
 from here, it would only effect those routes that happen to hit that same
 router. Now what would really hurt us is if something similar happens with a
 router that we tend to go through consistently. Like our gateway, or maybe
 the second hop router too. Find these with <Command>traceroute</Command>, by

 It's a little tempting on this last real-life example to think this gateway
 router is acting up. But, as it turned out, this was the result of a problem
 in the DSLAM/ATM segment of the telco's network. So any first hop problem
 with packet loss or high latency, may actually be the result of something
 occurring before the first hop. We just don't have the tools to isolate
 where it is starting well enough. Packet loss can be a telco problem, just as
 much as an ISP/NSP problem.

</Para>

<Para>
 It is also quite possible for the modem itself to cause packet loss. The fix
 here is to power cycle the modem, and resync by unplugging the DSL connection
 for 30 seconds or so. In fact, any part of the connection can be a source of 
 packet loss -- modem, DSLAM, ATM network, etc.

<Title>Measuring Throughput</Title>

<Para>
 No such thing as too fast, right? One of the first things most of us do is
 check our speeds to make sure we aren't getting short changed, and that our
 system is up to snuff. Doing this accurately is easier said than done
 however. First, remember you are losing 10-20% right off the top due to
 networking overhead. Just how much is 'lost' here depends on your provider's
 network architecture and other considerations. 
</Para>

<Para> 
 Then, any time you hit the Internet, there is some slight degradation of
 performance with each hop you take. Now this may not amount to much, as long
 as you are not taking too many hops and all the components -- your system,
 your ISP's network, your ISP's upstream provider, and the destination itself
 -- are all working like well oiled machines. But there's the rub -- how do
 you really know with so many variables in the mix? One flaky interface, on
 one router, on one hop along the path, may cause misleading results.

</Para>

<Para>
 Your absolute max speed is going to be at your point of connection to your
 ISP -- the ISP's gateway. It can only go downhill from there, not up! So the
 ideal test is as close to home as possible. This eliminates as many unknown
 variables as possible. If your ISP has a local ftp server, this is an
 excellent place to run your own tests. (Run a traceroute though just to see
 how local it really is.) 
</Para> 
 
<Para> 
 If your ISP does not have this, look for an ftp site that is close -- the
 fewer the hops, the better. And look for one that isn't too busy, or you will
 get misleading results. Find a large file -- like 10 Megs -- and time the
 download. Try this over several days, and at different times of day. The
 server, and the backbone, are going to be busier at certain times of day,
 which can skew results and you want to eliminate these variables as much as
 possible. Your provider cannot compensate for heavy backbone traffic,
 backbone bottlenecks, slow or busy servers, etc. 

</Para>

<Para>
 There are many test sites scattered around the web. Some are better than
 others, but take these with a grain of salt. There are just too many
 variables for these tests to reliably give you an accurate snapshot of your
 connection and throughput. They may give you a general picture of whether you
 are in the ballpark of where you think you should be or not. One good speed
 test is <Ulink
 URL="http://www.dslreports.com/stest/0">http://www.dslreports.com/stest/0</Ulink>.
 Another test is <Ulink

 Now keeping in mind that we are limited by the ~10-20% networking overhead rule,
 here is an example. My speed is capped at 1472 Kbps. Minus the ~15% is 1275
 Kbps. My sync rate is known to be good and my distance to the CO is about
 9000 Ft, which is close enough that I should be able to hit my real world

 <Emphasis>Big Caution</Emphasis>: my ISP uses a caching proxy server for
 web pages. This is a big equalizer for these kinds of web based

 from the proxy -- NOT the test site. Just FYI. Another note: at the same time
 I tried another test site and was consistently getting 600-700 Kbps. So YMMV
 with these tests. (Usually I get the same on each, more or less.) Timing a

<Sect1 id="overview">
<Title>Appendix: DSL Overview</Title>


<Para>
 DSL is a telephone loop technology that uses existing copper phones lines, 
 and provides a dedicated, high speed Internet connection. One of the big
 advantages of some DSLs (notably ADSL), are that they can co-exist on the
 same line with a traditional voice service or 'POTS' (Plain Old Telephone
 Service). This is accomplished by utilizing different frequency ranges above
 the voice range (voice is up to 4KHz). Essentially, this gives two lines in
 one: one for POTS, and one for Internet connectivity. When all is working
 normally, there should be no interference between the two 'lines'. This gives
 DSL a potentially broad consumer base, and helps minimize costs for 
 providers.

</Para>

<Para>
 DSL is positioned for the Home and Small Office (SOHO) market that is 
 looking for high speed Internet access at reasonable prices. Since it also
 typically provides dedicated, 'always on' access, it can be used for
 interconnecting low to mid range bandwidth servers, and provides a great
 access solution for small LANs. It is also great for those Linux power users
 that just want a fast pipe  :-).

</Para>

<Para>
 Phone companies, and other independent telecommunications providers (CLECs),
 are now deploying DSL as fast as they can to stay ahead of the Cable
 companies -- the main consumer and SOHO competition for DSL providers. This
 mad rush to get 'a piece of the pie', is bringing much competition (a good
 thing!), much diversity, and some confusion, into the consumer market.
 The DSL provider (often, but not always, the phone company) will provide the
 DSL infrastructure. This would include your line, the DSLAM, and physical
 connection to the outside world. From there it is typically picked up by an
 ISP, who provides the traditional Internet services.
 
</Para>


<Para>
 Consumer DSL plans are typically 'best effort' services. While boasting
 speeds approaching T1, and even surpassing that in some cases, it is not
 necessarily as reliable as T1 however. Business class DSL offers more
 reliability at a higher cost than consumer plans, and is a good compromise
 where both reliability and bandwidth are at a premium. All in all, the cost
 of DSL compared to traditional telco services, such as T1, is attractive and
 substantially more affordable for home and small business users.

<comment> DSL generally does not offer service contracts for home users, while
DSL for business offers similar SLAs (Service Level Agreements) to that offered
when getting a T1 line.

See next para. HB.

 DSL providers generally do not have service contracts for home users,
 while business class DSL services typically do include similar SLA (service
 level agreements) to that offered for a T1 line.

</Para>

<Para>
 The downside is that DSL is not available everywhere. Availability, and
 available bit rate (speed), are purely a function of where you live, where
 the telco has installed the prerequisite hardware, how far you are from the
 DSLAM/CO, and the quality of your phone line (loop). Not all loops are
 created equal, unfortunately. The primary limitation is distance.

 <Para>
   Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop. This DSL type currently supports
   downstream rates up to 8 Mbps, and upstream of 1024 Kbps, hence the
   'asymmetric'. The most widely deployed form of DSL at this time, and was
   specifically developed for the home and SOHO markets. The higher downstream
   rates lends itself to those not running serious servers -- at least
   anything more than a small, personal web site. ADSL is capable of sharing
   data with a POTS voice line, so an additional line is not required. A big
   selling point. ADSL, like other DSLs, is limited by distance. 18,000 ft
   (5.5 km) is a typical cut-off point for telcos. ADSL does typically require
   either a splitter or filters to isolate the DSL signal from POTS.
   Sometimes referred to as 'full rate' ADSL in order to differentiate it from
   G.Lite DSL. There are two common line encodings for ADSL: DMT and CAP. DMT
   (a.k.a. Alcatel compatible) has won the standards battle and is now the
   more common of the two. Also, note that modems must be compatible with the
   encoding. In other words, a CAP modem will not work with a DMT service, and
   vice versa.

   Sometimes called 'DSL Lite', 'Universal DSL' or 'splitterless ADSL', is a

   filters. The isolation of voice and data signals is handled at the CO.
   Currently G.Lite supports speeds up to 1.5 Mbps/512 Kbps, and is expected
   to eventually become the dominant consumer DSL service. As of this writing,
   it is not as wide spread as 'full rate' ADSL however.

  <Para> 
   Single-pair Digital Subscriber Loop, or also sometimes referred to
   as 'Symmetric Digital Subscriber Loop' since it is indeed symmetric with a
   current maximum rate of 1.5 Mbps/1.5 Mbps. SDSL requires a dedicated line,
   and thus true SDSL is not as readily adaptable to the consumer market as
   ADSL. SDSL also uses a 2B1Q encoding (same as ISDN and some T1) which is
   considered more robust than the DMT or CAP encoding of ADSL. True SDSL is
   generally considered more of a server quality DSL. It is worth noting that
   some providers may be marketing a 'SDSL' service that is really ADSL pinched
   so that upstream/downstream are the same. Wasn't all this confusing enough
   already?

<comment> Why is Symmetric DSL wrong?  It IS always symmetric...

Actually the term here 'Single Line (or pair)' was coined to explicitly to
differentiate it from HDSL, which required multiple pairs for significant
speeds. This was (is) is big drawback to HDSL. It is coincidence that it is
also symmetric. So a technicality really, and who really cares anyway ;)

Also, noted that 'some T1' uses 2B1Q, but cannot find the reference where I
originally got that from.

   ISDN Digital Subscriber Loop, 144 Kbps/144 Kbps is really a new and
   improved ISDN from Lucent Technologies and uses the same 2B1Q line encoding
   as ISDN, SDSL and others. IDSL does require a dedicated line however. The
   benefits are that it is an 'always on' technology, like other DSLs, and
   provides an additional 16 Kbps over traditional ISDN. It is being marketed
   by some DSL providers as a low end bit rate option, where line quality is
   not sufficient for higher speeds such as that of ADSL.

<comment> What in the HECK is 2B1Q?  I've got a total of 8 fiber T1s, and 4
copper t1s coming into our office, and I've NEVER heard of that.  Out basic

 in the telco's Central Office. DSLAMs come in various shapes and sizes, and
 are the one, single complex and costly component of a DSL connection. When
 a qualified phone line is connected to a modem at the user's end of the loop,
 a high speed digital connection is established, typically over ATM, or
 sometimes frame relay. The DSLAM splits the signal back into separate voice
 and data channels. The voice channel stays within the telco network, whereas
 the data is picked up by an ISP.

<Sect3>
<Title>Sync</Title>
 
<Para> 
 A good, working connection to the DSLAM is referred to as 'syncing'. Without
 sync, nothing happens. The modem will establish a sync rate which is often
 throttled by the provider at a predefined limit. This limit, or 'cap', is at
 the provider's discretion and is part of the service that is being provided.
 Your modem may well sync at a higher rate than the 'cap', but your speed will
 be limited to whatever 'cap' the provider is enforcing. So while ADSL has an
 upward theoretical limit of 8 Mbps, you will not see that speed -- unless of
 course your provider is selling an 8 Mbps plan. Most plans are well below
 this.

</Para>

<Para>
 Below is the status information from a SpeedStream 5660 modem/router via the
 built-in telnet interface. In this example, the customer is on a 1.5 Mbps/384

<Para>
 First notice the 'Current Attainable Rate' in the 'ATU-C' column. This is the
 downstream sync rate negotiated by the modem and DSLAM, which is over
 3.5 Mbps. The actual speed is limited, however, to 1.5 Mbps/384 Kbps from the
 first row 'TX Rate'. This is the theoretical limit of this connection. This
 limit, or 'cap', can be enforced at the DSLAM, as is the case the here, or
 further upstream. Had the first row 'TX Rate' been lower than the provider's
 imposed limit, then this would indicate some kind of problem with the
 connection, perhaps due to distance or some kind of line impairment. 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 The attainable sync rate is the result of a number of factors, including wire
 distance to the DSLAM, quality of both inside and outside wiring, the loop
 wire gauge and various other factors within the loop.  Actual measurable,
 real world throughput, on the other hand, is first of all dependent on sync
 rate. Low sync rate means low throughput. In the above example, had the sync
 rate been lower, say 500 Kbps, then that would be the maximum for that
 connection, even though the customer is paying for a 1.5 Mbps service.
</Para> 
 
<Para> 
 Secondarily, throughput will depend also on the ISP's network, and then the
 ISP's upstream provider.  You will lose approximately 10-20% of potential
 throughput to networking overhead. In the above example where the connection
 is throttled at 1.5 Mbps, the actual, real-world maximum throughput would be
 somewhere around 1.2-1.3 Mbps when overhead is taken into account. Moreover,
 once you hit the Internet proper, all bets are off as there are any number of
 factors that may impact throughput. A overloaded or busy server is likely to
 be slow no matter how fast your DSL connection is.

<Sect2 id="dslmodems">
<Title>DSL Modems</Title>

<Para>
 The modem is the last piece of the connection. The modem is connected
 directly to the DSLAM via the copper loop on the telco end, and plugs into a
 wall jack on your end. When all is well, the modem 'syncs' with the DSLAM,
 and then makes an IP connection to the ISP, and off we go!

</Para>

<Para>
 For Linux users, <Emphasis>the modem is a very important
 consideration</Emphasis>! You will need an external, ethernet interfaced
 modem (or modem/router combo) that connects via a standard NIC, since
 virtually all other modem options (PCI, USB, onboard) will not work due to a
 lack of drivers at this time! All ethernet based modems will work fine. 
</Para>

<Para> 
 The only potential compatibility issue is the Network Card (NIC). (And really
 any compatible ethernet NIC should do just fine -- 100 Mbps is not
 necessary.) You are probably better off anyway, since PCI and USB modems are
 more problem prone.  If your chosen provider does not offer a compatible
 modem as an option, then you either need to look elsewhere, or you will have
 to buy one outright from a third party.

</Para>

<Para>
 As always, there are exceptions.  Diamond makes an internal PCI modem
 which has binary-only drivers, but it is not in widespread
 use. <Ulink url="http://www.efficient.com">Efficient Networks</Ulink>
 is beta testing Linux drivers for their SpeedStream 3060 and 3061 PCI
 modems, and is expected to release them <quote>any day</quote>.  This
 will require a 2.4.x kernel, and a patch for the necessary ATM
 support. Efficient is working with kernel developers to make their
 products Linux compatible. The initial version will have binary
 drivers only, but open sourced drivers are a future possibility. It
 is also possible to make a direct ATM connection using a modem plus
 an ATM card, though this delivery system is not used in the U.S.  as
 far as I know, and should not be considered as a viable option. This
 would also require a 2.4 kernel.

</Para>

<Para>
 The most common type of modem in use today is actually a combination 'bridge'
 and modem device. The bridge is a simple device, typically with little
 configuration.  Network traffic passes blindly across the bridge in either
 direction. Your point of exposure is the interface (typically a NIC) that is
 connected to the modem/bridge.  
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Some ISPs may also be offering 'routers'. These are basically combination
 modem/routers that can handle NAT, and may have other feature enhancements
 such as port forwarding, a built in hub, etc. These are all external, so
 should work too. But probably not a big deal for Linux users, since Linux can
 do anything these do, and more. A locked down Linux box makes a most
 excellent firewall/gateway/proxy! 

</Para>

<Para>
To confuse things even more, there are also all-in-one devices: combo
bridge+router+modem, sometimes called 'brouters'. In this case, the modem can 
be configured for either bridging or routing -- but it can't be both at the
same time.

</Para>

<Para>
 All providers should make available a 'modem' of some sort. Many ISPs will have
 more than one modem option. Some may give away the modem at no additional
 charge. Some may offer a free base model, and charge the difference for the
 better models with more features. Many of the modems that ISPs supply are not
 available through normal retail channels. Should you want to buy one
 yourself, this leaves used equipment outlets (e.g. ebay), or possibly buying
 a modem that your ISP may not support (i.e. a possibility of no tech support
 if you have a problem). 
</Para>

<Para>
 While some ISPs provide modems that are not readily available through normal
 retail channels, there are a number of manufacturers that are getting on the
 DSL modem bandwagon, and offering a good selection. Most have a
 number of enhancements. At this time Netgear, Linksys, Zyxel, Cisco, 3Com,
 and Cayman have products available. Depending on model and feature set,
 prices range from a little over $100 US to $800 and up. Many of these 
 handle their own authentication and encapsulation (DHCP, PPPoE, etc).
 
</Para>

<Para>
 Are some modems better than others? Well, fortunately for us the external,
 ethernet interfaced modems are the most reliable anyway. Fewer IRQ hassles,
 no buggy drivers, etc. So a blessing in disguise really. Are any of these
 better than others? Probably not. None are faster anyway. Certainly some may
 have more features, like the combo modem/routers. But realistically, most of
 this is so new there is not enough of a track record to compare brands and
 models with any degree of assurance. In other words, any old external,
 ethernet modem should do -- provided it matches your provider's DSL, and is
 configured for that service. 

<comment>I don't see the question "Are some modems better than
others?" being answered here.  The second sentence isn't very readable
to me, possibly just because of punctuation.</comment>

</Para>

<Para>
<comment>How about using the "warning" tag here instead?
http://www.docbook.org/tdg/html/warning.html</comment>

 <Emphasis remap="bold">Warning!</Emphasis>  Make sure any third party modem
 or router you may purchase is compatible with your DSL provider. There are
 two major line encodings for ADSL (CAP, DMT a.k.a. Alcatel compatible), and
 several options for IP encapsulation. And different DSLs (SDSL, IDSL, etc)
 will require their own modem too. Your provider should have a list of
 compatible options.  It may well have to be configured for your ISP's service
 too. Don't expect it to work right out of the box either (unless it comes
 from your provider).  Many are accessible via telnet, or a web browser, where
 the configuration options are available. See the owner's manual for this.

<Title>The ISP Connection</Title>

<Para>
 The modem connects to the DSLAM, and then the DSLAM is connected to the
 telco's ATM network (or frame relay), where it is picked up by the ISP. The
 ISP will take over at what we 'see' as the first hop on a
 <Command>traceroute</Command>.  Everything up to that point is in the hands
 of the telco/DSL provider. The ISP will connect to the ATM side of the DSLAM
 via a high-speed data connection, usually ATM over a T3 (45 Mbps) or OC-3
 (155 Mbps). The important thing here is that an ISP must 'subscribe' with
 your telco to provide this connection. The ISP will provide traditional ISP
 type services: email, DNS, news, etc. It is really a two step connection --
 DSL from one provider, Internet from a second -- even though these may be
 combined into one billing. 

</Para>

<Para>
 The Baby Bells (RBOCs) all own ISPs. These, of course, are
 connected to their DSLAMs, and are providing Internet services via the
 telco's ISP subsidiary.  Many independent ISPs are availing
 themselves of the ILEC's DSL services, and in essence 'reselling' the DSL
 services of the ILEC. While the underlying infrastructure is the same in this
 case, having more than one ISP working out of a CO may mean a better
 selection of features and prices for the consumer. 
 
<comment>I have a note on my printed copy to "pick and acronym", but
I'm not sure which term I wanted you to pick an acronym for.  It would
be good to make sure that you're consistent throughout the whole
document with your use of acronyms, just as good authoring policy.
</comment>

</Para>

<Para>
 CLECs (independent telcos) are now installing their own DSLAMs. This
 makes them a direct competitor to the ILEC. In this scenario, there would be
 two (or more) DSL providers in the same CO, each with their own DSLAM(s), and
 each competing against each other. This complicates the ISP situation even
 further, as each DSL provider will be 'partnered' with one or more ISPs. If
 you are lucky here, you will have many choices of plans and pricing
 structures.

</Para>

<Para>
 Typically, your service agreement is with the ISP, and not the DSL
 provider.  This makes the actual DSL provider a 'behind the scenes'
 player.  This may vary, and in some cases, you may wind up with a
 separate service agreement for both the DSL provider and the ISP.

<Title>Availability</Title>

<Para>
 Who can get DSL? The first requirement is that a telco has installed the
 necessary hardware in your CO. You have no choice on which CO is yours -- it
 is wherever your loop terminates. If your CO has a DSLAM, and the necessary
 other components, then DSL may be available to you. This is often known as
 'pre-qualifying', and is Step One in getting service.

 Before ordering service, check to see what providers there are in your area.
 You may have several options, including the large phone companies, as well as
 smaller, local ISPs. Once an order is placed, you must wait for the
 qualification process before a provider will agree to provide service.

<Sect3 id="qualify">
<Title>Qualifying</Title>

<Para>
 Once local availability is established, the next step is 'qualifying' your
 loop. The provider will run various tests to make sure that your loop can
 handle the DSL signal. This is to determine how suitable your line is for
 DSL, and maybe what level of service will be available to you. You probably
 will have to order service just to find out this much. It can be a fairly
 involved process, with a variety of different tests being run. There
 are a number of things that may 'disqualify' a line. The most common
 limitation is distance. 
</Para>

<Para> 
 All DSLs have distance limitations. ADSL is limited
 to a loop length of roughly 18,000 ft (5.5 km), but the actual cut off point
 will vary from provider to provider. The further away you are, the weaker the
 signal, and the potential for poor connections is greater. With ADSL, if you
 are within approximately 12,000 ft (3.7 km), you should be able to get at
 least 1.5 Mbps -- all other things being equal. IDSL has even greater reach,
 mainly because the maximum speed for IDSL is considerably lower at 144
 Kbps/144 Kbps.

</Para>

<Para>
 Still even if you're close enough, there are a number of potential
 impediments that may disqualify a line. Two such common impediments
 are load coils and bridge taps. These are aspects of the old telco
 infrastructure that once were deemed beneficial, but now are getting
 in the way of the newer, digital technologies.  <comment>This next
 sentence could stand rephrasing</comment> Whether you hit a snag like
 this, is pretty much hit or miss.  Fiber anywhere in the loop is also
 a disqualifier. The provider may take steps to 'clean' the line. Just
 how far they are willing to go will vary from provider to provider,
 and this will likely add additional time to the installation process.

</Para>

<Para>
 Once the line is 'qualified', the next step is deciding on which plan is
 suitable for your situation.  The provider may have differing plans available
 depending on how strong a signal they think your line can handle. If you are
 marginal, you will not be qualified for the higher speed plans. And if price
 is a factor, having a tiered pricing structure is good also since the lower
 end plans are obviously less expensive. How this is structured also varies
 wildly from provider to provider. Since, DSL is a new service, and providers
 are trying to find the right price/feature combinations that will attract the
 most users and thus gain a competitive edge.

 and a near infinite number of other possibilities. The cost of different
 plans generally goes up with their speed.
</Para>

<Para>
 Should you be disqualified, and have other options, get a second opinion.
 Calculating the effective loop length is by no means an exact science. There
 is plenty of room for errors. Also, some providers may go to greater lengths
 to 'clean' the loop than others. And, if you have more than one phone line,
 and are disqualified, then try the other line. Just because they both
 terminate at your location, does not necessarily mean they are the same
 length! The telco network is full of surprises.

 Some Frequently Asked Questions about DSL and Linux.
</Para>

<Para>
<OrderedList>
 
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. Does DSL work with Linux?
  </Para>

  <Para>
   DSL is a technology, or more correctly, a group of related technologies.
   This is akin to asking if Linux works with telephones. The technology
   itself does not care. So, the short answer is 'Yes, of course!'. The long
   answer is that if there are any impediments, they are being imposed by the
   provider. There are things they may do that can make getting Linux up and
   running a more of a challenge than it needs to be. Not having a compatible
   modem option available is one common gotcha. If the telco or ISP is
   doing the installation, they may require a Windows or Mac system to be
   available. This saves them the costs of training their techs on various
   'alternative' OSes. Buyer beware!

  </Para>
   
  <Para>
   Basically all DSL does, is facilitate a high speed Internet connection. At
   some point, it is all TCP/IP, and Linux, of course, handles TCP/IP quite
   well.

  </Para>
   
 </ListItem> 

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
   Q. Where can I find drivers for my PCI (or USB) modem?
  </Para>

   <Para>
    As of this moment, you probably can't, because they are not available. You
    need an external, ethernet interfaced modem for all intents and purposes.
    If your provider does not offer one, you will have to find another
    provider, or buy your own modem outright. Just make sure it is compatible
    with your provider's flavor of DSL.
    
   </Para>
   
   <Para>
    If an incompatible modem puts you in a bind, hopefully you will take the
    time to politely harass the manufacturer  :-).
    
   </Para>

   <Para>
    This situation will likely change soon however. <Ulink
    URL="http://www.efficient.com">Efficient Networks</Ulink> is in late Beta
    stages with their SpeedStream 3060/3061 PCI drivers. Others will likely
    follow suit. (Make sure you are reading the latest version of this
    document, as I have intentions of keeping this situation updated as
    needed.)
   
   </Para>

  </ListItem> 

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
     Q. How fast or good of a network card do I need?
   </Para>
  
    <Para>
     Any card that is compatible with Linux should work fine. Remember even
     low-end cards are 10 Mbps, and no consumer class DSL is near that at this
     time. I would suggest a reasonably good quality card, just to help
     eliminate the possibility of errors and premature failure.
     
    </Para>
  </ListItem> 

 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. How can I find out when DSL will be available in my area?
  </Para>

   Just where and when DSL gets deployed is totally in the hands of
   your friendly local telco. They obviously can't do everyone at
   once, so they probably are selecting areas based on competitive
   factors. Getting a straight answer from a telco on this question
   can also be a challenge.  Probably so as not to tip their hand to
   competitors. Unfortunately, it is a question only they can answer.

   Move? Seriously, there isn't much you can do. If there are other providers, 
   get another opinion. You never know. Determining the loop length is an
   inexact science, and there is room for errors. Many use databases for
   this, and these databases routinely have some inaccuracies. Some providers
   too, may be more aggressive in taking steps to help you out and clean up
   the line. Also, some providers offer low-end speed services that have
   greater reach. Maybe this will become available in your area. Or, the telco
   will install, at some point, remote devices for customers who are now too
   far away.

   No, and no. The modem has little bearing on how fast your connection is for

  <Para>
   You will lose 10-20% of the rated capacity due to networking overhead. This
   is just a fact of life for everybody. Just how much is lost here depends on 
   a number of factors, and may vary from provider to provider. You seem to be
   close to your maximum when this is taken into consideration. Also, if you
   read the fine print, many ISPs are advertising speeds 'up to' such and
   such. Check your service agreement and see if there are any guarantees. If
   there are, they probably are well below the advertised maximum speed.

   Also, be careful how you test this. Some of the so-called test sites can be
   pretty unreliable. There can be many factors between you and that site that

   how many people might be trying that same test at the same time. The best 
   test is via FTP download from a known good, close site.

    Q. Why does PPPoX have such a bad rap?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
    The tendency to abruptly disconnect is one of the biggest gripes. PPP is
    sensitive to any interruptions in the connection. Generally a disconnect
    means a new IP. And there are those that say PPP, by its very nature, was
    never meant to be an 'always on' protocol. PPP is a session management
    protocol at heart, that requires a user to initiate a connection and
    authenticate him or herself. PPPoE/A are not particularly mature protocols
    either. They do not have much of a history or track record. Some would say
    the telcos and hardware manufacturers have rushed this out the door. PPPoE
    also requires an additional layer of software just to maintain the
    connection. This is one more layer of code and one more potential point of
    failure. Also, more system overhead is utilized to manage the connection.
    
   </Para>

 </ListItem>

 
 <ListItem>
  <Para>
    Q. Why PPPoX? This seems like a bad idea!
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   PPP gives several advantages to the provider: they can use their existing
   infrastructure and hardware that they now use for their (larger) dialup
   customer base. It is easier to control user authentication and potential
   abuse situations, and easier to manage their network and related issues. In
   fact, it most boils down to its just easier for them. Easier, means saves
   man hours, and therefore saves costs (at least from their perspective).
  
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   It is not a conspiracy to conserve IP addresses, or thwart heavy users. IP
   address costs are insignificant in the overall scheme of things.
   
  </Para>

     <comment>In case you're not aware, it's illegal to sell or lease
     IP addresses.  Most ISPs get around this via a "service charge"
     associated with having multiple IPs. </comment>

    Q. The only provider in my area does not support Linux. What can I do?
    Will I have to use Windows?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   NO! 'Support' here is support as in 'tech support'. They are just saying
   that they will not give you tech support when and if you have problems.
   This does not mean you cannot use Linux on their network. Just that you may
   have to fend for yourself when and if a problem does arise. Anything that
   is forbidden will be in their Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), or Terms of
   Service (TOS) agreement.
   
  </Para>

  <Para>
   I have heard stories where a new tech or installer has misinterpreted their
   own company's policy on this and told someone 'you can't use Linux here'.
   Same with NT server. But this is almost always a misinformed individual.
 
  </Para>

   onto a Linux box. Hopefully, they will have a self-install option to get
   around this annoyance. YMMV.

    Q. My fax software does not work with my DSL modem. Why is that?
  
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
    Faxes are normally transmitted over typical analog phone lines by dialing 
    the fax machine on the other end. Analog modems can handle this, but 
    DSL modems have no dialing capability. Don't throw out that 56K yet!

    Q. How fast and powerful of a computer do I need for DSL? My ISP says I
    need at least a Pentium 200.
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
    At the most basic level, a 386 will work fine. In most situations, you are
    connected to what is essentially an ethernet based network. So
    theoretically anything that can handle a very slow ethernet connection
    would work. No comment on well Netscape will run on a 386 though ;-) But as
    far as managing the connection, a 386 is indeed workable. What else you
    can do with it is another matter.
    
  </Para>

  <Para>
    Where this gets a little more complicated is the modem, and the client
    that the ISP may require. Any PCI or USB modem is going to require
    drivers, which means more CPU and system resources. Also, PPPoE does even
    more processing, so again the potential CPU load is increased. Windows
    tends to be not so efficient with all this going on, hence the requirement
    for mid range Pentiums by some ISPs.
    
  </Para>

  <Para>
   With Linux it will depend on what you are going to do. A low end Pentium
   should be fine for most uses. Just remember if you are running PPPoE, you
   may take a performance hit on low end hardware.

    Q. I just got my DSL installed, and my speed sucks, and/or my connection

  </Para>
  
  <Para>
    Not enough information to say, really. There are many, many things that
    can cause a lousy connection. The list is too long to mention them all.
    
  </Para>
   
  <Para>
    One of DSL's weaknesses is that the signal can be fairly fragile. Many
    things can degrade the signal, making for poor connections, and thus
    speed. This can be caused by poor or substandard inside wiring, a wiring
    problem outside (like bad splice), RFI from any number of sources, AM
    radio signal interference, excessive distance from the DSLAM. Not to
    mention possible hardware problems with your modem, NIC, or the telco's
    DSLAM, etc. Not always easy to sort out.
 
  </Para>

  <Para>
   Your provider should be able to assist you. First, make sure the problem
   isn't with your setup as they likely won't help solve a Linux problem. Then
   be persistent, and don't hesitate to go over someone's head if the help is
   not forthcoming. Most problems are solvable. The trick is isolating it. A
   good telco tech, trained for DSL, can find all kinds of obscure wiring
   problems.

   Q: Why does DSL have all these bit rates (384/1.5/7.1M/20M/etc) options?
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   A: The basic problem is the 100 year old design of the copper loop. It works
   great for analog phone, but it presents a real challenge for a digital
   signal. Remember that the distance of a loop is inversely proportional to the
   data rate that it can carry. Rate adaptive technologies are great for making
   a digital signal work in many situations, but it can't provide a consistent
   bandwidth for all applications, especially for very long (over 18,000 ft)
   loops. The different bandwidths that you see advertised reflect various
   marketing wars of vendors equipment, and the telco struggle to finalize on a
   'standard' set of data rates. The bottom line is for the telco to be able
   to reach as broad a customer base as possible.

   Q: What are all these loop impairments (bridge taps, load coils, DLCs) that

  </Para>

     <comment>A consistent definition format is needed here.  I'd use
     a variablelist, but it doesn't really matter as long as you use
     the same format for all of the definitions.</comment>

  <Para>
   Load coils: in-line inductances that improve voice-frequency transmission
   characteristics of a telephone circuit.  Essentially, a "load" steals energy
   from high frequencies and gives it to lower frequencies.  Typically only used
   in very long (&gt;9,000 ft) phone lines.
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   By "bridges" I assume you mean "bridged taps".  In older neighborhoods, the
   phone wiring will have been used by more than one customer.  Perhaps these
   customers lived at different (though near-by) addresses.  The unconnected
   "spur" of wiring is a "bridged tab" on the currently connected circuit.
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   DLCs, Digital Loop Carriers: there's a bunch of systems for carrying more
   than one voice transmission on a single pair of wires.  You can shift the
   frequencies up or down, or you can digitize the voice transmissions and
   divide the telephone circuit by time or code or something.  The more
   general term is "pair gain".
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   These things cause different problems for high-frequency communications.
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   Load coils will completely mess up things by filtering high frequencies and
   passing low frequencies.  They probably also change the "delay envelope",
   allowing some frequencies to arrive before others.  One byte's tones will
   interfere with the next byte's.
  </Para>

     <comment>This next paragraph is Greek to me.  Well, maybe just
     Russian.  :-)  In any case, it's certainly geek...</comment>

  <Para>
   Bridged taps act as shunt capacitances if they're long in relation to the
   signals wavelength, and they'll actually act as band pass filters if they're
   about 1/4 wavelength of the signal.  That is, they'll pass particular
   frequencies freely.  Particular tones of a DMT modem might get shunted back,
   rather than passed along to the receiving modem, reducing bandwidth for that
   telephone line.
  </Para>
 
  <Para>
   Pair gain, digital or analog, limit the bandwidth available to one
   transmission in order to multiplex several on one wire.  High and low tones
   of a DMT transmission get filtered out by the apparatus.
  </Para>
  
  <Para>
   The book "Subscriber Loop Signaling and Transmission Handbook", by Whitham D.
   Reeve, , IEEE Press 1992, ISBN 0-87942-274-2 covers the math of how to
   calculate the effect of line length, bridged tap, etc on the transmission
   characteristics of a telephone line.  It's pretty expensive, however.

  <Term>Splitterless</Term>

   <ListItem>
   <Para>
    A DSL installation that does not require a splitter. For higher
    speeds, a RJ11 filter (sometimes called microfilters) is placed on every
    extension phone jack where an analog phone or other non-DSL device is
    used, thus filtering the DSL signal at the jack, rather than at the
    SNI/NID.  For lower speeds, no filter is necessary.  Without a filter or
    splitter, the DSL signal tends to cause audible interference on voice
    phones. G.Lite needs no splitter, nor filter, but this is the exception to
    the rule.

<Sect3 id="cable">
<Title>Cable Modem vs DSL</Title>

<Para>
 The Telcos see DSL as a competitor to the Cable Company's Cable
 Modem, and as such, are providing competitive pricing and configuration
 offerings. Although Cable Modems are advertised as having 10-30Mbps potential 
 bandwidth, they use a shared transmission medium with many other users on the
 same line, and therefore performance varies, perhaps greatly, with the amount
 of traffic, time of day, and number of other users on the same node.  

</Para>

<Para>
 It is often heard that DSL has an advantage in that it is a private pipe to
 the Internet, with dedicated bandwidth. This is mostly a myth. You do have a
 private pipe to the DSLAM, but at that point, you enter the telco's ATM (or
 frame relay) network, and start sharing bandwidth. You are at the mercy of
 how well your DSL provider and ISP manage their networks. The consensus seems
 to be that DSL providers and ISPs are doing a better job of managing
 bandwidth than the Cable companies. It is easier for them to add and adjust
 bandwidth as needed to meet demand. You are less likely to have speed
 fluctuations due to other users being on line at the same time. But, again,
 this gets down to how well the network and bandwidth are managed.

</Para>


<Para>
 DSL probably has a small security advantage too. With most Cable modem
 networks, it is like being on a big LAN. You are sharing your connection (and
 bandwidth) right at the point of connection. But if you are not doing
 something to filter incoming connections already, you are asking for trouble
 either way. 
</Para>

<Para>
 There also seems to be a better chance of having ISP alternatives with DSL
 than Cable. Choice is a good thing, and so is competition. It seems most
 Cable outfits give you just one choice for an ISP. If you don't like it, you
 are out of luck. The number of options with DSL probably varies greatly by
 geographic areas. Populous areas, like Northeast U.S., seem to have many
 options. 
</Para>

<Para>
 So which is better? The differences aren't as much with the technology, as they
 are with the implementations. If you look around, you can find plenty of
 horror stories on either. And plenty of happy customers too. The way
 to know what may be the best for you, is to do comparative shopping based on
 experiences of other users in your area. Don't base your choice on one
 person's opinion. This is statistically invalid. Likewise, don't base your
 choice on someone's opinion who has had a particular service for only a short
 time. Again, statistically not worth much. Get as many opinions from those
 that are using the <Emphasis>exact same services</Emphasis> that you are
 looking at.

<Sect3>
<Title>Integrated Fiber in the Loop (IFITL or FTTC)</Title>

<Para>
 In some areas, newer neighborhoods are being built with fiber optic cable
 instead of the traditional telco copper lines. While the fiber is a definite
 problem for DSL services, it has it's own potential advantages. Existing
 fiber is potentially capable of 100 Mbps, and it looks like this could easily
 go up soon. 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 So while telco fiber customers are being shut out of the DSL market, they may
 have much to look forward to. Technologies are under development, and in some
 cases just now being deployed, to take advantage of fiber telco phone loops.
 Known as 'FTTC' (Fiber To The Curb), or 'IFITL' (Integrated Fiber In The
 Loop), this technology is another high speed service that telcos can offer.
 The speeds are sufficient for VoD (Video on Demand) and VoDSL (Voice over
 DSL), and other high bandwidth services. One nice advantage here is, that
 since there is no DSL signal on the wire, the only required CPE is a network
 card. In other words, no modem -- just connect a NIC to the wall jack and off
 you go!

By 'friendly' we mean ISPs that don't put up any unnecessary impediments just
because you aren't running that other guy's OS. And yes, there is some of
that going around. If your choices are limited, and you are forced to deal
with one of these, then having a Windows box available temporarily is one work
around. Another, may be to sweet talk the installer into letting you finish
the installation (NIC, etc). Of course, self installation, if available,
should be completely 'Linux compatible'.
 
</Para>

<Para>
 So to make this list, the ISP/provider must make available some type of
 workable modem (ethernet interface at this point in time), nor should 
 penalize you, or make things difficult, just because you are running an
 alternate OS. Installing directly onto Linux should be an available option,
 and should not cause you any undue hardship. Technical support for Linux is a
 nice bonus, but not necessary to make the list. Please do not take these as
 recommendations, do your own homework.

<Title id="linrouter">Setting up Linux as a Router</Title>


<Para>
 Depending on your local setup, you should consider some other issues.  These
 include a firewall setup, and any associated configurations.  For my setup,
 shown in Figure 5 below, I use an old i486 machine configured as a
 firewall/router between the DSL connection and the rest of my home network.
 I use private IP addresses on my private LAN subnet, and have configured my
 router to provide IP Masquerading and Firewalling between the LAN and
 WAN connection. 

</Para> 

<Para>
 See the <Ulink
 URL="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/IP-Masquerade-HOWTO.html">IP
 Masquerade HOWTO</Ulink> , and <Ulink
 URL="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Firewall-HOWTO.html">Firewall
 HOWTO</Ulink> for more information.  For 2.4 kernels see the <Ulink
 URL="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-HOWTO.html"
>Linux 2.4 Advanced Routing HOWTO</Ulink>. My experience is that Linux is more
 flexible and provides superior routing/firewalling performance. It is
 much less expensive than a commercial router -- if you find an old 486 machine
 that you may be using as a doorstop somewhere.

</Para>


<Para>
 What I did is setup a Linux router (Redhat Linux 5.0  on a i486) with two
 ethernet interfaces. One interface routes to the ISP subnet/gateway (eth0 in
 above example), and the other interface (eth1 above) goes to a hub (or switch)
 and then connects the LAN with private network addresses (e.g. 192.168.1.x).
 Using the private network address behind your router/firewall allows some
 additional security because it is not directly addressable from outside. You
 have to explicitly masquerade your private addresses in order to connect to
 the Internet from the LAN. The LAN hosts will access the Internet via the
 second NIC (eth1) in the Linux router. Just set their gateway to the IP
 address of the second NIC, and assign them addresses on the same network.

</Para>

<Para>
 <Emphasis remap="bf">Caution</Emphasis> Make sure your kernel is complied
 with IP forwarding and the IP forwarding is turned on. You can check this
 with '<Command>cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</Command>'. The value is '1'
 for on, and '0' for off.  You can change this value by echoing the desired
 value into this file:
</Para>

<Screen>

 # echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
 
</Screen>

<Para>
 You will also need to set up 'IP Masquerading' on the Linux router. Depending
 on your kernel version, this is done with <Command>ipfwadm</Command> (2.0),
 <Command>ipchains</Command> (2.2), or <Command>iptables</Command> (2.4).
 See the documentation for specifics on each. AND -- do not forget to have
 that firewall set up too! 
 
</Para>

<Para>
 There are also several projects that are devoted specifically to using Linux
 as a router, just for this type of situation. These are all-in-one solutions,
 that include security and various other features. Installation and
 configuration, is reportedly very easy. And these will run on very minimal
 hardware -- like a floppy drive only.  The best known is <Ulink
