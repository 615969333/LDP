<sect2 id="conventions">
<title>Conventions Used in this Document</title>

<para>
The following conventions are used in this document and are outlined here for those who may not yet have a complete understanding of how to access and control the underlying operating system in Linux, which is almost always via the Bash shell.
</para>

<para>
First, filenames are referenced in a paragraph like so: <filename>/path/file</filename>
</para>

<para>
Commands in Linux are executed (or 'called') at the command prompt, otherwise known as the 'command line'. 

If you are in the non-graphical (text-based) environment, you will usually be presented with the Bash shell prompt which is a dollar sign: 
</para>

<para>
	<screen>$</screen>
</para>

<para>
	...or the hash mark: 
</para>

<para>
	<screen>#</screen>
</para>

<para>
...if you have logged in as root, have acquired root, or 'superuser' privileges.
	
You can also access the Bash shell in the X window system, otherwise known as X or X11,	with an <ulink url="http://invisible-island.net/xterm/">xterm</ulink> or similar X-terminal-emulator.

Commands to be performed at the Bash prompt, but referenced in a paragraph of this document, usually look like this: <command>do this now</command>
</para>

<para>
Commands and/or the resulting output of commands may also be outlined with screen output in their own paragraph or heading:
</para>

<para>
	<screen>$ date
Sun Jul 27 22:37:11 CDT 2003</screen>
</para>

<para>
	When a command is written in front of the Bash prompt (e.g., <command>$ date</command> above), it is assumed the [Return] or [Enter] key has been pressed after the command, possibly followed by the output on a new line (e.g., as in the date in the above example).
	</para>

<title>Supporting the Connection Type</title>

<sect2 id="usb-type">

<title>USB Webcams</title>

<para>
If you have a USB webcam, it is very possible your hardware has at least some support in Linux.

There are two ways of supporting USB devices in Linux. 

One is the more tradtional kernel support, and the other is through libusb. 

If you would prefer the more conventional kernel support for USB devices, go on to <xref linkend="usb-kernel">. 
</para>

<sect3 id="libusb">

<title>Libusb</title>

<para>
Libusb is a library that allows access to the USB functions in linux through userspace and without the need to enable kernel support and insert modules. 

Most distributions, at this point, are offering <ulink url="http://libusb.sourceforge.net/">libusb</ulink> in their stable branches (and some install it by default), so if you don't already have kernel support for USB devices, then you may only have to install the libusb package in order to access your device.

You must have USB device filesystem support enabled in your kernel, which most distributions do. 

To find out for sure, issue the following at the command line:
</para>

<para>
	<screen>$ cat /proc/filesystems</screen></para>
<para>
You should see (among others):</para>
<para>
<screen>
	nodev   usbdevfs
	nodev   usbfs
</screen>
</para>

<para>
You may need to mount usbdevfs to enable it and see the device files, which you can do at the command line with <command>mount -t usbdevfs none /proc/bus/usb</command>. 
	
Don't try to use libusb while your particular <emphasis>kernel</emphasis> webcam support is enabled either statically or the module loaded; you can only use one at at time.</para>

<para>
You can obtain the libusb package in <filename>.rpm</filename>, <filename>.tgz</filename> or <filename>.deb</filename> format from your Linux distribution.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="usb-kernel">

<title>Linux Kernel USB Support</title> 

<para>
Kernel support is required for USB webcam support (if not using libusb). 

Your stock kernel may already have support for what you need and the way to tell is to use the <command>dmesg</command> command and look for an acknowledgement that the driver in question was loaded at bootup. 

In general, USB webcams require the module <filename>usbvideo</filename> to function. 

If you don't see it, the driver may be present (but not necessarily loaded) as a module. 

To find out, you can type the following at the command line:</para>

<para>
	<screen> $  ls -R /lib/modules/X.XX/kernel/drivers </screen>
</para>

<para>
Where 'X.XX' is your kernel version number. 

The following output is an example of what you might find in a USB webcam-ready kernel, where everything is loaded as a module (though all but the relevant lines have been edited for brevity):</para>

<para>

<screen>
	./usb:
	usbvideo.o
	usbcore.o
	ibmcam.o

</screen>
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>(A hint for newbies: if the info in dmesg or the above module list scrolls by too fast, you might try	piping the output into 'less' (or 'more' if you don't have less): 

<command>ls -R /lib/modules/X.XX/kernel/drivers | less </command> or alternatively catching it in a file: <command>ls -R /lib/modules/X.XX/kernel/drivers > file.txt</command>, where 'file.txt' will contain the info that can then be accessed with <command>cat [file] | less</command>.)</emphasis></para>

<para>
If your kernel doesn't contain the necessary support, you can always recompile your kernel. 

If you are unfamiliar with the process of compiling your own kernel, I direct you to the <ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">Kernel HOWTO</ulink> for more information.
</para>

<para>
For generic USB bus support in Linux, you will need USB subsystem support in your kernel, whether usb-ohci, usb-ehci, or whatever flavor of USB driver your system prefers. 

USB subsystem support has been present in the Linux kernel since the late 2.2 series. 

For a more in-depth discussion of USB support in general, I direct you to the <ulink url="http://www.linux-usb.org/">linux-usb project site</ulink>. 

If you want to find out which modules are loaded, at the command line or in an xterm, type the following:

<para>
	<screen># lsmod</screen></para>

<para>
As shown by the prompt above, you will need to have root privileges to do this. 

You should get output similar to the following:</para>

<para>
	<screen>
		cdrom                  29312   0  (autoclean) [sr_mod]
		usb-ohci               17888   0  (unused)
		usbcore                56768   0  [scanner ibmcam usbvideo usb-ohci]
		ibmcam                 39680   0 
	</screen>
</para>

<para>
If you don't have the particular module you're seeking loaded and you know you have it included as a module in your kernel, try loading it directly (using the usb ibmcam module as an example):</para>

<para>
	<screen># modprobe -v ibmcam</screen>
</para>

<para>
...at which point you should see something like the following:</para>

<para>
<screen>Using /lib/modules/2.4.20/kernel/drivers/usb/ibmcam.o</screen></para>

<para>	
By placing the entry <filename>ibmcam</filename> (for example) in <filename>/etc/modules</filename> (note that this varies by distribution), you can have the module load at boot-time automatically.

You can then confirm the module was loaded by checking the syslog or in the boot-time record with <command>dmesg | less</command>), where you should see an entry such as the following:</para>

<para>
	<screen>
		Oct 18 12:43:12 K7 kernel: hub.c: new USB device 00:02.3-2, assigned address 3
		Oct 18 12:43:12 K7 kernel: ibmcam.c: IBM PC Camera USB camera found (model 2, rev. 0x030a)

<sect2 id="IEEE1394">

<title>IEEE 1394 (<trademark>Firewire</trademark>, <trademark>i.Link</trademark>)</title>

<para>
IEEE 1394 webcams require an IEEE 1394 PCI card in your computer for access. 

The IEEE interface has been supported in Linux since the early 2.4-series kernel. 

If you are lucky enough to own such a device, generic information on support of the IEEE 1394 bus in Linux can be found at <ulink url="http://www.linux1394.org">www.linux1394.org</ulink>. 
	
If you have a kernel older than 2.4.2, you will need to patch your kernel with one of the patches found on <ulink url="http://download.sourceforge.net/linux1394">this page</ulink> matched to your kernel version. 
	
In addition, you will require <ulink url="http://download.sourceforge.net/libraw1394">libraw1394</ulink>. 	

The previously referenced linux1394.org site has a great installation guide.</para>

<para>
The <ulink url="http://www.tele.ucl.ac.be/PEOPLE/DOUXCHAMPS/ieee1394/cameras/">IEEE1394 Digital Camera List</ulink>, by Damien Douxchamps, offers an outstanding summary of the capabilities of IEEE 1394 cameras as well as the current status of support for individual models.

<sect2 id="parport-general">

<title>Generic Parallel Port Support for Parport Webcams</title>

<para>
For 2.2 and 2.4 kernel systems, parallel-port support must be enabled statically or as a module (stock kernels usually have this enabled by default). 
	
You may want to read <ulink url="http://www.torque.net/linux-pp.html">more generic info about parallel-port device support under the Linux kernel</ulink> before starting this process. 

To find out for sure if the module <filename>parport</filename> is loaded, you can check the <filename>dmesg</filename> file or use <command> lsmod </command> as outlined above.

Using <command>dmesg | less</command>, you should see (among many other lines) the following:
</para>

<para>
	<screen>
		Mar  3 08:00:25 K7 kernel: parport0: PC-style at 0x378 (0x778) [PCSPP,TRISTATE]
		Mar  3 08:00:25 K7 kernel: parport0: irq 7 detected
	</screen>
</para>

<para>
If you are compiling your own kernel, enable 'Parallel Port support'. 

You should enable 'IEEE 1284 transfer modes', and if you have x86 type architecture, you should also enable 'PC-style hardware'.
</para>

<para>
If modprobe returns an error when you attempt to load the module, note that you may need to determine and supply the hardware address when invoking <command>modprobe</command>. 

The most common address is 0x378 for an x86 system; 0x278 and 0x3BC are other possibilities for integrated or ISA parallel ports.

Add-in PCI parallel ports may have unusual base addresses. 

You can also arrange multiple devices with either the parport_pc or parport_arc modules, though that topic is beyond the scope of this document. 

<emphasis>WARNING: </emphasis>Be sure you have the correct address before entering this information at the command line or else your machine may become unstable, crash or otherwise implode.</para>

<para>
Your parallel port should be set to preferably <quote>EPP</quote> mode, or alternatively ECP/EPP. 

<quote>Bidirectional</quote> (also known as <quote>BPP</quote> or <quote>PS/2</quote>) may work, albeit much more slowly. 

<quote>Unidirectional</quote> mode is unsuitable for scanning. 

The above setting can usually be accessed through your BIOS menu, at least on x86 systems.</para>

<sect1 id="dev-intro">

<title>Making and Accessing the Video Device</title>

<sect2 id="devfsd">

<title>Device Filesystem</title>
<para>
<ulink url="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/docs/devfs.html">

Devfs</ulink>, or 'device filesystem', has been	an option in the Linux kernel since the late 2.2 series. 

If you haven't used it up to this point, then I would suggest you at least consider it. 

It can immensely simplify device management.

Devfsd, the device filesystem daemon, creates and removes devices on your system dynamically without the need for user input. 

You can tell if your system is running devfsd if you run <command>ls -f /dev/</command> at the command line or in an xterm, and see mostly symlinks pointing to a device file, or <quote>node</quote> within a logically ordered hierarchy of subdirectories within <filename>/dev</filename>. 

You can also see devfsd running when you check running programs with <command>ps -A</command> at the command line. 

The daemon consumes very little memory. 
	
If you are running devfsd/devfs, you can probably skip the following sections as the archaic process of creating device	nodes will be done for you, and it's simply a matter of finding the device by selecting the appropriate symlink in <filename>/dev</filename>.
</para>

<para>
If you want to give devfs a try, you need to enable '/dev file system' and 'Automatically mount at boot' in the	'File Systems' section of kernel configuration. 

Yes, it absolutely requires a recompile of your kernel if you don't have it in there already. 

<emphasis>WARNING: </emphasis>The only other supporting package required is 'devfsd', which you can obtain from your distribution vendor. 

<emphasis>WARNING: </emphasis>If you enable devicefs to automatically mount at boot-time without installing the devfs daemon, you will be left with an unbootable system!</para>


<para>
Devfs does not obviate the need to change permissions of devices for access by users.</para>

<para>
Naturally, the above comments about devfs are the opinion of your humble author (among others) and should be treated as just that, especially if you are a relative newbie or are not quite ready to compile your own kernel. 
</para>

<para>
Beginning in the 2.6 series kernel devfs has been deprecated in favor of a userspace (i.e., non-kernel) daemon known as udev, though devfs remains as an option. 

You can find information on udev <ulink url="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-FAQ">here</ulink> if you are inclined to live on the bleeding edge.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="dev-manual">

<title>Creating Video Devices Manually</title>

<para>
If you aren't running devfs and devfsd, this is how it will need to be done, unless you are using libusb or udev in which case you can skip this step. 

A device can be created as a block (such as a drive), a fifo (file-in-file-out or pipe, as in xconsole) or a character device, which represents other hardware.

Each device has a major and a minor number <quote>coordinate</quote> to tell the kernel what it is and where to	access it. 

These numbers are not arbitrary.</para>

<para>
Video4linux device nodes are used to access video devices (including webcams) and have the major number 81 and minor number 0, 1, 2, etc... 

First, check <filename>/dev</filename> to see what directory your distribution lays out its video devices in. 

Some distributions might have the video device(s) in the root <filename>/dev</filename> directory, such as <filename>/dev/video0, /dev/video1</filename>...and so on. 

Others might place them within <filename>/dev/v4l</filename> or in <filename>/dev/video</filename>. 

If you find that the video devices are already present (made by your distributor or devfsd) then your work is done except for possibly permissions. 

If not, you will need to create the device nodes yourself. 
	
You can use the following script, which I have borrowed from the kernel source (located in <filename>linux/Documentation/video4linux/bttv/MAKEDEV</filename> of the source tree):</para>

<para>
	<screen>
		#!/bin/bash

		function makedev () {

		        for dev in 0 1 2 3; do
	        	echo "/dev/$1$dev: char 81 $[ $2 + $dev ]"
		        rm -f /dev/$1$dev
	        	mknod /dev/$1$dev c 81 $[ $2 + $dev ]
		        chmod 666 /dev/$1$dev
	        done
 
	 	# symlink for default device
			rm -f /dev/$1
			ln -s /dev/${1}0 /dev/$1
		}

		# see http://roadrunner.swansea.uk.linux.org/v4lapi.shtml
			echo "*** new device names ***"
			makedev video 0
			makedev radio 64
			makedev vtx 192
			makedev vbi 224
		# "*** old device names (for compatibility only) ***"
		#makedev bttv 0
		#makedev bttv-fm 64
		#makedev bttv-vbi 224
	</screen>
</para>

<para>
Simply copy and paste the above into your favorite editing program, save it as MAKEDEV or whatever name you like and then make it executable (i.e., <command>chmod u+x MAKEDEV</command>). 

Next, execute it as root:
</para>

<para>

	<screen>
		# ./MAKEDEV
	</screen>
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="permissions">

<title>Groups and Permissions</title>

<para>
It is a good idea to be sure that your user account can access the device once all modules are loaded and device nodes created. 

The most security-conscious way to do that is to add access for a particular group. 

On my system, the members of the group 'video' are allowed to use the webcam, scanner and other photographic devices. 

The way to accomplish this is to first change the ownership of the devices in <filename>/dev</filename> like so (as root):
</para>

<para>
	<screen>

		# chown root.video /dev/usb/video1*

	</screen>
</para>

<para>
...where <command>root.video</command> are the owner and group the device will now belong to. 

Obviously, the specific	command will vary by your system and the type of device. 

It is important that you change the ownership of the device node itself and not the symlink; symlinks' ownerships are affected only by changing the parent devices or files they point to.
</para>

<para>
To see if your user account is a member of the group in question, as root issue the following command: 
	
<command>grep -e video /etc/group</command>. 

You should see something like the following:</para>

<para>
	<screen>
		video:x:44:
	</screen>
</para>

<para>
...where '44' is the group number. 

Since no members follow the last colon in the 'video' group, we can add them, let's say user 'jhs' with the command</para>

<para>
	<screen>
		# adduser jhs  video
	</screen>
</para>

<para>
After this, it's simply a matter of allowing read and write access for the user in question of the device like so:
</para>

<para>
	<screen>
		# chmod g+rw /dev/v4l/video0
	</screen>
</para>

<para>
...where <command>g+rw</command> means add <command>r</command>ead and <command>w</command>rite access for <command>g</command>roup. 

See the documentation for chmod (<command>man chmod</command> or <command>info chmod</command>)	for further info.</para>

The home page is at <ulink url="http://bytesex.org/xawtv">http://bytesex.org/xawtv</ulink>.

You'll probably want to install an already packaged rpm, tgz or deb of xawtv; though, courageous or curious types can always get the latest source from the previous link.
</para>

<para>
When you first try out your webcam, and you think things are configured right, use the -hwscan option:
</para>

<para>
	<screen>
		$ xawtv -hwscan
		This is xawtv-3.72, running on Linux/i686 (2.4.21)
		looking for available devices

		/dev/v4l/video0: OK                     [ -device /dev/v4l/video0 ]
		type : v4l
		name : BT878(Hauppauge (bt878))
		flags: overlay capture tuner 

		/dev/v4l/video1: OK                     [ -device /dev/v4l/video1 ]
		type : v4l
		name : IBM USB Camera
		flags:  capture 
	</screen>
</para>

<para>
...so now you can see the available devices (your output may differ substantially). 

Try opening an xterm and running xawtv, grabbing from your webcam video device:
</para>

<para>
	<screen>
		$ xawtv -c /dev/video1  
		This is xawtv-3.72, running on Linux/i686 (2.4.21)
	</screen>
</para>

<para>	
...and (hopefully) your camera will begin capturing to a window on your desktop. 
	
You may see some error messages in your xterm if things don't work that can be helpful to diagnose configuration problems. 

If you aren't interested in all that, and things work for you, launch from your window manager's menu next time. 

You can read about more xawtv options with <command>man xawtv</command>.

<title>Streamer</title>

<para>
Streamer is a versatile program that allows a capture from a webcam or video device using only the command line. 

It may be in your Xawtv package already (or may need to be fetched separately as in Debian), and is available at the Xawtv homepage referenced in <xref linkend="xawtv">. 

It is a great program for automating camera functions. 

For example, to take a standard JPEG picture from the command line where the camera is accessed through <filename>/dev/video1</filename>:
</para>

<para>
	<screen>
		$ streamer -c /dev/video1 -b 16 -o outfile.jpeg
	</screen>
</para>

<para>
...where <command>-b</command> is the number of colors (in bpp, whether 15, 16, 24 or 32) and <command>-o</command> is the output filename that will be dropped into the current directory (specify <command> -o </command><filename>/path/outfile.jpg</filename> to place it elsewhere).</para>

<para>
To make an .avi file:
</para>

<para>
	<screen>
		$ streamer -q -c /dev/video1 -f rgb24 -r 3 -t 00:30:00 -o /home/jhs/outfile.avi
	</screen>
</para>
	
<para>
...where <command>-q</command> is for 'quiet' execution (no message output), <command>-f</command> is 'format' (rgb24 is TrueColor avi), <command>-r</command> is the frames per second and <command>-t</command> is the time of recording (30 minutes). 

Streamer can capture raw and <trademark>Quicktime</trademark> (non-Sorensen) formats and can capture audio as well.

Motion is a brilliant program that is able to monitor the video signal from one or several webcams. 

It can record periodic snapshots, and when motion is detected, record an mpeg and/or perform another action such as sending an email or executing a command. 

It can track and graphically mark the motion it detects, feed files via an http	server to your website, stream them to another application and more. 

It is accessed through the command line and the number of options may be intimidating; there is however, a <ulink url="http://www.lavrsen.dk/sources/webcam/motion_guide.htm">guide available online</ulink> that outlines the various command and configuration file options nicely.

<title>Help, my camera has a driver that is source-only, i.e., has to be built by me! Where do I start?</title>
<para>
First, check if your Linux distribution offers a pre-compiled binary of the driver. 

If that is not the case, be sure you have kernel sources installed. 

You will also need at a minimum GNU make, gcc, binutils and perhaps other programs installed depending on your distribution. 

Download the driver source (in this example named <filename>src.tar.gz</filename>) and uncompress/untar it:
</para>

<para>
	<screen>
		$ tar -xvzf src.tar.gz
	</screen>

Then, change to the directory of your kernel source:

	<screen>
		# cd /usr/src/linux
	</screen>

Make the necessary source files:

	<screen>

		# make oldconfig
		# make dep
	</screen>

Now, change to the directory where you unpacked the driver source and read the README and/or INSTALL files for instructions on how to make the driver. 

Usually this involves some combination of "make" "make all" and/or "make install." 

Assuming it compiles correctly, you can simply load the new module with <command>modprobe</command>. 
	
If you have any problems, see <xref linkend="morehelp">.

<sect2 id="patch">
<title>Help, my camera is supported by a driver that has to be patched into my kernel! What do I do?</title>

</para>

<para>
The short and unguaranteed version of patching, by your humble author, goes as follows: Be sure you have the same prerequisites outlined in <xref linkend="src"> installed. 

First, on the command line or in an xterm change to the	source directory of the kernel version you are (or will be) running with the camera patch (in this example named <filename>patch.diff</filename>). 
</para>

<para>
	<screen>
		# cd /usr/src/linux
		# patch -p1 -E patch.diff

	</screen>
</para>

<para>
You should see a confirmation that the 'hunks' were successfully applied. 
	
At this point, you can <command>make menuconfig</command> or whatever program you use to recompile, enabling the appropriate support. 

If any of the hunks failed, or you run into any problems in addition to the link referenced above you, should consult <command>man patch</command> and <xref linkend="morehelp">.

	software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
	program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
	software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
	it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
	whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
	principally for works in which its purpose is instruction or reference.
</para>

<para>
1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
</para>

<para>
	This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
	contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
	distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
	world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
	work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
	refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
	licensee and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
	copy, modify, or distribute the work in a way, thus requiring permission
	under copyright law.
</para>

<para>
	A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
	Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
	modifications and/or translated into another language.
</para>

<para>
	A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
	the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
	publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
	(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
	within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
	textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
	mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
	connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
	commercial, philosophical, ethical, or political position regarding
	them.
</para>

<para>
	The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections in which titles
	are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
	that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
	section does not fit the above definition of Secondary, then it is not
	allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
	Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
	Sections, then there are none.
</para>

<para>
	The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
	as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
	the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
	be at most five words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
</para>

<para>
	A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
	represented in a format where its specification is available to the
	general public, that is suitable for revising the document
	straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
	pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
	drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
	for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
	to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
	format in which its markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
	or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
	An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
	of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
</para>

<para>
	Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
	ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
	or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
	HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
	transparent image formats include PNG, XCF, and JPG.  Opaque formats
	include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
	proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
	processing tools are not generally available, and the
	machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
	processors for output purposes only.
</para>

<para>
	The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
	plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
	this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
	formats, which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
	the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
	preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
</para>

<para>
	A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document in which its
	title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
	text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
	specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
	"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
	of such a section, when you modify the Document, means that it remains a
	section "Entitled XYZ", according to this definition.
</para>

<para>
	The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
	states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
	Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
	License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
	implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
	no effect on the meaning of this License.
</para>

<para>
2. VERBATIM COPYING
</para>

<para>
	You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
	commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
	copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
	to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
	conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
	technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
	copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
	compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
	number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</para>

<para>
	You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
	you may publicly display copies.
</para>

<para>
3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
</para>

<para>
	If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
	printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
	Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
	copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
	Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
	the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
	you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
	the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
	visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
	Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
	the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
	as verbatim copying in other respects.
</para>

<para>
	If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
	legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
	reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
	pages.
</para>

<para>
	If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
	more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
	copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
	a computer-network location from which the general network-using
	public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
	a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
	If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
	when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
	that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
	location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
	Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
	edition to the public.
</para>

<para>
	It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
	Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
	them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
</para>

<para>
4. MODIFICATIONS
</para>

<para>
	You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
	the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
	the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
	Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
	and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
	of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
</para>

<para>
	A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
	from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
	(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
	of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
	if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
</para>

<para>
	B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
	responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
	Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
	Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
	unless they release you from this requirement.
</para>

<para>
	C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
	Modified Version, as the publisher.
</para>

<para>
	D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
</para>

<para>
	E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
	adjacent to the other copyright notices.
</para>

<para>
	F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
	giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
	terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
</para>

<para>
	G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
	and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
</para>

<para>
	H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
</para>

<para>
	I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
	to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
	publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
	there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
	stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
	given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
	Version as stated in the previous sentence.
</para>

<para>
	J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
	public access to a Transparent copy of the Document and likewise
	the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
	it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
	You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
	least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
	publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
</para>

<para>
	K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
	Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
	the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
	and/or dedications given therein.
</para>

<para>
	L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
	unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
	or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
</para>

<para>
	M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
	may not be included in the Modified Version.
</para>

<para>
	N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
	or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
</para>

<para>
	O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
	If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
	appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
	copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
	of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
	list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
	These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
	You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
	nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
	parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
	been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
	standard.
</para>

<para>
	You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
	passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
	of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
	Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
	through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
	includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
	by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
	you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
	permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
</para>

<para>
	The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
	give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
	imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
</para>

<para>
5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
</para>

<para>
	You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
	License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
	versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
	Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
	list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
	license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
</para>

<para>
	The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
	multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
	copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
	different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
	adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
	author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
	Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
	Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
</para>

<para>
	In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
	in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
	"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
	and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
	Entitled "Endorsements".
</para>

<para>
6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
</para>

<para>
	You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
	released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
	License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
	the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
	verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
</para>

<para>
	You may extract a single document from such a collection and distribute
	it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
	License into the extracted document and follow this License in all
	other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
</para>

<para>
7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
</para>

<para>
	A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
	and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
	distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
	resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
	of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
	When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
	apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
	derivative works of the Document.
</para>

<para>
	If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
	copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
	the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
	covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
	electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
	Otherwise, they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
	aggregate.
</para>

<para>
8. TRANSLATION
</para>

<para>
	Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
	distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
	Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
	permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
	translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
	original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
	translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
	Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
	the original English version of this License and the original versions
	of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
	the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
	or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
</para>

<para>
	If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
	"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
	its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.
</para>

<para>
9. TERMINATION
</para>

<para>
	You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
	as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
	copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document is void and will
	automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
	parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
	License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
	parties remain in full compliance.
</para>

<para>
10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
</para>

<para>
	The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
	of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
	versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may
	differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  
	See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
</para>

<para>
	Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
	If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
	License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
	following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
	of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
	Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
	number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
	as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
</para>

<para>
ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
</para>

<para>
	To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
	the License in the document and put the following copyright and
	license notices just after the title page:
</para>

<para>
	Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
	Permission is granted to copy, distribute, and/or modify this document
	under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
	or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
	with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
	A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
	Free Documentation License".
</para>

<para>
	If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
	replace the "with...Texts." line with this:
	with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
	Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
	If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
	combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
	situation.
</para>

<para>
	If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
	recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
	free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
	to permit their use in free software.
</para>
