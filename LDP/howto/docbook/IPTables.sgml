   <abstract>
      <para>
      This document describes the main functions of the Netfilter Packet 
      filter (IPTables) included in the 2.4.x series kernels.

<title>Introduction</title>
<para>
I felt the need to write this HOWTO because of, what I thought, is the poor
level of documentation of implementing Packet Filtering firewalls using the 2.4.x Netfilter packet filter. The HOWTO covers using native IPTables commands (ie. not using the ipchains.o) to implement a packet-filter based firewall and the various supported types of NAT.

a Duron 950Mhz (all I could easily afford) with 256MB SDRAM, Voodoo 4
Video Card, ATI All-in-Wonder Pro Video Card. I also have a 266Mhz Cyrix

<ulink url="http://www.consultmatt.co.uk">http://www.consultmatt.co.uk</ulink>
you will be using. </para>

<sect1 id="whatis">
<title>What is IPTables</title>
<para>IPtables (known as Netfilter) was written by Paul Russell and the other 
members of the <ulink url="http://netfilter.samba.org">Netfiler Project 
Team</ulink>. It was meant as a replacement for IPChains that was implemented
in the 2.2.x series kernels. It offers true 1:1 NAT capabilities, Packet 
filtering and connection tracking.</para>

<para>One major upshot of this is that due to the implementation of connection
tracking you can allow incoming connections by whether or not they relate to
an established connection. There is still some need for helper modules for
some conenction types. (FTP and IRC at the moment)</para>

<sect1 id="req">
<title>Requirements</title>
<para>You only need a couple of things to get IPTables going, these include:</para>

   <itemizedlist>
     <listitem><para>A 2.4.x series kernel with the Netfilter modules compiled.
     (I will deal with the Netfilter code as modules but feel free to compile
     them in and ignore the module information.)</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>The IPTables source code, get it from <ulink
     url="http://netfilter.samba.org">The Netfilter Project</ulink>
     </para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>This HOWTO <emphasis role="strong">does not</emphasis>
     cover compiling and/or installing IPTables. Usually this is pre-installed
     with a 2.4.x distro and if not then please consult the Netfilter website
     for more information.</para></listitem>
