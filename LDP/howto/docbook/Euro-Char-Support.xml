This document describes how to make the Euro character support in
GNU/Linux work. Finnish users might be interested to consult the Finnish 
HOWTO which is written in Finnish.

<title>The Euro Character</title>

<para>
The new character set, <emphasis>ISO-8859-15</emphasis> which is also known 
as <emphasis>latin9</emphasis> and
to maximize confusion as <emphasis>latin0</emphasis>, was created to 
replace <emphasis>ISO-8859-1 (latin1)</emphasis>
and it includes euro and cent characters.
</para>

<para>
The Euro is mapped to keys <emphasis>AltGr-e</emphasis> and the cent is mapped 
to <emphasis>AltGr-Shift</emphasis> in X and on  AltGr-c on console.
</para>

<para>
The Euro Mini HOWTO was written on a Debian system and the set up
works on Debian Woody (Debian testing as the time of writing).

<title>Plea for Help</title>

<para>
The state Euro support in Linux and in UNIX in general is rather depressing. 
The console applications and xterm works. Emacsen does not. Gnome and KDE 
must be set up separately and their exact state is unknown me. I use neither
but I can test Gnome. Any KDE user out there: please tell me how Euro support
can be set up in KDE.
</para>

<title>The Euro and Locales</title>

<para>
<emphasis>glibc 2.2</emphasis> and newer support the Euro. The correct locale 
is, for example, <emphasis>fi_FI@euro</emphasis>.
</para>

<title>The Euro and the Console</title>

<para>
Check that the file /usr/share/keymaps/include/euro.inc.gz includes lines
</para>

<screen>
altgr keycode  18 = currency
altgr keycode  46 = cent
</screen>

<para>
A console font, which suppports euro, must be loaded. Red Hat uses
command setfont and Debian uses command consolechars.
</para>

<para>
In Debian the file /etc/console-tools/config must have ISO-8859-15
screen font:
</para>

<screen>
       SCREEN_FONT=lat0-16
</screen>

<para>
In Red Hat the file /etc/sysconfig/i18n must have lines
</para>

<screen>
   SYSFONT=lat0-16
   SYSFONTACM=iso15
</screen>

<title>The Euro in the X Window System</title>

<para>
With default configuration <emphasis>AltGr-e</emphasis> (the <emphasis>right 
Alt</emphasis> for those who have
no AltGr) produces the generic currency symbol which looks like a four
legged spider.  When the font of the program is changed to a
<emphasis>ISO-8859-15</emphasis> font the currency symbol is replaced by 
the Euro symbol. In Debian 
this can be achieved by adding line 
</para>

<screen>
     .XTerm.VT100.font: -*-courier-*-*-*-*-*-100-*-*-*-*-iso8859-15
</screen>

<para>
to the file <filename>/etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm</filename>. The fonts 
available in distributions and installations vary.
</para>

<para>
If AltGr-e does not work add line 
</para>

<screen>
   keycode 26 = e E EuroSign
</screen>

<para>
to the file /etc/X11/Xmodmap
