<Sect1 id="intro">
<Title>Introduction</Title>

<Para>
 One of the most annoying sets of problems I have had to deal with is the
 abysmal default fonts and font settings of X (I'm talking specifically about
 <Ulink url="http://www.xfree.org">XFree86</Ulink>, other versions of X may be
 better.) Many programs use fixed width default fonts when a variable width
 font would be more appropriate. Other programs use fonts that are
 ridiculously tiny and unreadable. The fonts that are bundled with XFree86 are
 barely adequate for the job. It does come with a halfway decent courier font,
 but its Times and Helvetica fonts are simple bitmap fonts that pixelize when
 they are scaled. Yuck! 

</Para>

<Para>
 This HOWTO attempts to show how to adjust various font settings, install new
 fonts, and do other things that will greatly improve the appearance and
 readability of fonts on the X Window Desktop. This is done by adjusting the
 <Literal>FontPath</Literal> in the <FileName>XF86Config</FileName> file, by
 adding switches to X server command line in <Command>startx</Command> or
 <Command>xdm</Command> (and variants), by adding new fonts, by installing a
 TrueType font server and fonts, and by using a feature in the K Desktop
 Environment 1.1 that automagically adjusts font settings in many
 applications, including non-KDE apps to set their fonts and colors to match
 KDE's style settings.

    Where examples of commands are used, a <quote>#</quote> character is used to

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    The examples use <FileName>/usr/local/share/fonts/ttfonts</FileName> as our

    References to "xfs" are to the xfs as packaged by Redhat for versions 6.x
    and later. This differs significantly in some respects from the stock
    XFree86 xfs. 
   </Para>
  </ListItem>
 
  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    References to "Netscape" are to the entire suite of programs from Netscape:
    Communicator, Navigator, Messenger, etc. For all intents and purposes, font
    configuration in Mozilla is the same.

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    'XF86Config' is the X configuration file. For Redhat based distros, as of 
    Redhat 7.0, this is now 'XF86Config-4' for XFree86 4.x. For the most 
    part, we'll just use 'XF86Config' here.
   
   </Para>
  
   <Para>
    Also, while some aspects of XFree86 4.x configuration are the same as
    3.3.x, there are some significant differences. We'll only highlight the
    differences. So unless noted otherwise, any comments or examples will
    apply to both 3.x and 4.x versions.

<Title>X Server Configuration</Title>

<Para>
 There are a few easy steps that can be taken that will help X do its job 
 better.
</Para>


<!--   ~~~~~       New Section      ~~~~~     -->

<Sect2>
<Title>Setting The FontPath</Title>

<Para>
 The first place to look for curing font problems is the
 <FileName>XF86Config</FileName> file.
 <FileName>/usr/X11/lib/X11/XF86Config</FileName> or
 <FileName>/etc/X11/XF86Config</FileName> are the common locations. (This may
 be <FileName>XF86Config-4</FileName> for X 4.x.) If you haven't
 guessed already, the most important part of this file relating to fonts is
 the <Literal>FontPath.</Literal> Before we get into that, this would be a
 good time to check the other parts of your X configuration. Bad monitor
 settings can be even more of a headache than bad fonts, so make sure your
 refresh rate is as high as your monitor can handle (85 Hz is great, 75 Hz is
 OK, 60 Hz is painful.)                                      

</Para>


<Para>
 Use your favorite text editor and edit 
 <FileName>XF86Config</FileName>.  Near the top of the file in the
 "Files" section, you should see something like this:                 
 </Para>

<BlockQuote>
<Para>
 <Literal>
  <MSGText>
   <LiteralLayout>
FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"
FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/"
FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/"
FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/"
FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/"
   </LiteralLayout>
  </MSGText>
 </Literal>
</Para>
</BlockQuote>

<Para>
 This much should be the same, or at least similar, for both XFree86 3.x and
 4.x. The <Literal>FontPath</Literal> tells X where to find the fonts it uses
 to render text on your display.  Order is important -- when an X application
 asks X to render some text, the X server usually has some leeway to choose the
 font that is used.  The X server then goes through the
 <Literal>FontPath</Literal> and grabs the first font it sees that matches the
 X client's criteria, and then renders. Note that Redhat's xfs for versions 6.x
 and later has a different way of setting the <Literal>FontPath</Literal>. See
 the <xref LinkEnd="xfs"> below for more on xfs.

</Para>

<Para>
 If the 100dpi fonts are not listed, they probably did not get installed for 
 whatever reason, so you may want install them now. Default installations
 typically put 75dpi fonts before the 100dpi fonts. If you have a high
 resolution display, this means very tiny fonts. If this is the case, the
 first tweak you'll use is to switch the 75dpi and 100dpi FontPath lines:
</Para>

<BlockQuote>
 <Para>
  <Literal>
   <MSGText>
    <LiteralLayout>
FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"
FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/"
FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/"
FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/"
FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/"
    </LiteralLayout>
   </MSGText>
  </Literal>
 </Para>
</BlockQuote>

<Para>
 Next, specify that you prefer to use unscaled bitmap fonts.  If you've ever
 used Netscape or any other program that displays titles using big fonts,
 you'll likely notice that those fonts are pixelized.  This is ugly and needs
 to be fixed.  So add <Literal>:unscaled</Literal> to the ends of the misc,
 100dpi and 75dpi fonts.  You can even use both unscaled and scaled fonts if
 you want, just put the unscaled <Literal>FontPath</Literal> lines first to
 tell X you prefer unscaled fonts if possible:
</Para>

<BlockQuote>
 <Para>
  <Literal>
   <MSGText>
    <LiteralLayout>
FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc:unscaled"

FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi:unscaled"

<Title>X Server Command Line Options</Title>

<Para>
 The next thing you need to do is adjust the command line options for the X
 server. You'll want to use the <Literal>-dpi</Literal> switch which specifies
 the display resolution in dots per inch.  As a lot of systems use high
 resolution displays these days, chances are they'll be working at 100
 dpi.

 If you use xdm (or friends such as gdm) for graphical logins, you'll want to
 edit your <FileName>/usr/X11/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers</FileName> file (or
 possibly <FileName>/etc/X11/xdm/Xservers</FileName>) which will have the
 command line for the Xserver in it.  Mine has the line:

<Sect1 id="TrueType">
<Title >TrueType Fonts (One of the few things Windows is good for)
</Title>

<Para>
 Because the boys at Redmond are very concerned with the appearance of their
 software (as opposed to the internal workings ;) they built TrueType font
 support into Windows.  And of course, they got the idea from MacOS which is
 where TrueType originated. Windows 9x and nearly every other flavor of
 Windows comes with Arial, Times New Roman, and Courier New, which are roughly
 equivalent to Helvetica, Times and Courier. TrueType fonts are scalable, so
 they look good in large sizes, and they are well hinted, so they are readable
 at small sizes.  Many windows applications come with dozens more TrueType
 fonts.  Don't microwave your Windows CD yet, you'll want to get those fonts
 first!
</Para>

<Para>
 Unfortunately, XFree86 3.x does not come with built in TrueType support, so
 you'll have to add it yourself. XFree86 4.x does have built in support
 however (see <Xref LinkEnd="x-4x">). This will mean installing a font server
 that does support TrueType and, of course, installing the fonts themselves.
 You won't find decent TrueType fonts included with any distribution. The
 likely reason is that there are not any quality TrueType fonts available
 under a suitable license at this time.

</Para>



<!--   ~~~~~       New Section      ~~~~~     -->

<Sect2>
<Title>Making TrueType Fonts Available</Title>

<Para>
 Let's start with the fonts first. Any TrueType font included with the various
 MS Windows incarnations should work. Don't forget word processors and other
 apps that may include their own fonts too. MacOS fonts will not work. There
 are also some 'free' TrueType fonts available for download if you have
 already nuked that CD (see Links in <Xref LinkEnd="links">).
</Para>

<Para>
 In order to use TrueType, the fonts will have to be always accessible to the
 font server. This means they will have to be on a filesystem that is
 <Emphasis>always</Emphasis> mounted. This can conceivably be a Windows
 partition on a dual boot system. Alternately, the fonts can be copied to
 Linux.  First <Command>su</Command> to root: 
</Para>

<Para>
 <Literal>
  <MSGText>
   <LiteralLayout>
 # su -
 # mkdir -p /usr/local/share/fonts/ttfonts
   </LiteralLayout>
  </MSGText>
 </Literal>
</Para>

<Para>
 Now, change to the new font directory:
</Para>

<Para>
 <Literal>
  <MSGText>
   <LiteralLayout>
  # cd  /usr/local/share/fonts/ttfonts
   </LiteralLayout>
  </MSGText>
 </Literal>
</Para>


<Para>
 Then, add the fonts to this directory, either by copying them from your
 Windows system:
</Para>

<Para>
 <Literal>
  <MSGText>
   <LiteralLayout>

 These fonts are in self-extracting zip archives. You will need to get the ones
 labeled for use with 'Windows 3.1' if you need to extract them under Linux.
 You can indeed unpack these in Linux with the Linux zip utility:

<Para>
 The '-L' option will convert to lower case font names (this may be necessary for
 some versions of xfsft and Redhat's xfs). Note that the current Linux zip
 utility does not work with the 32 bit Win9x font archives. (It also looks
 like Microsoft no longer has the 16 bit Arial, Courier and Times-Roman on
 this site.) Or you can get an RPM of WebFonts that contains some of the MS
 TrueTypes <Ulink

 This has enough fonts to keep Netscape and other web browsers happy.

 You will also have to include the new TrueType directory(s) in the X server's

<Title>Font Servers</Title>

<Para>
 There are several font servers available that will do the job: xfstt, xfsft,
 and Redhat's patched version of xfs based on xfsft. While these names are all
 too similar, these are different packages.  One, or more, of these should be
 included with any recent Linux distribution, and you may have one installed
 already.  

</Para>

<Para>
 Historically, font servers were used to serve fonts over a network. Font 
 resources could then reside on one host, and clients could access them as 
 needed. But, the developers have enhanced these to include features such as 
 the ability to render TrueType fonts. (XFree86 4.x has this ability included
 already, and thus an additional font server is not really needed just solely
 for the purpose of having TrueType support.)

<Title>Installation</Title>

<Para>
 xfstt is <emphasis>very</emphasis> easy to install and configure.  If it isn't

<Title>Redhat's xfs</Title>

<Para>
 As of Redhat Linux 6.0, Redhat based distributions (Mandrake, etc) have
 included a specially patched version of xfs, the XFree86 Font Server, and
 patched X servers as well. Redhat's xfs includes the xfsft patch set which in
 turn is built upon the FreeType Font library. Redhat's xfs provides similar
 functionality to xfstt. xfs is able to serve both TrueType and Type 1 fonts,
 as well as legacy X fonts. 
</Para>

<Para>
 If you are using a Redhat based distro, you should have xfs installed
 already. If not, it is in the <FileName>XFree86-xfs*rpm</FileName>. To make

<Title>Setting the xfs FontPath</Title>

<Para>
 The default Redhat installation of xfs serves fonts via a Unix Domain Socket.
 We'll need to tell the X server where to look for xfs, and thus fonts. The
 FontPath in <FileName>/etc/X11/XF86Config</FileName> must include for Redhat 
 6.x:
</Para>

<BlockQuote>
 <Para>

    <LiteralLayout>
 FontPath   "unix/:-1"

 </Para>
</BlockQuote>



<Para>
 At least for a default configurations. This is a reference to the socket where
 xfs is listening. You may include additional FontPaths, but these will be
 handled by the X server, and not xfs.  A clean install of Redhat 6/7 should
 have this already set up, but if you are upgrading from an older version, you
 may have to change this yourself!  

</Para>

<Para>
 xfs then has its own, separate FontPath stored in
 <FileName>/etc/X11/fs/config</FileName>. This is where it will look to find
 fonts. This is over and above the X server's FontPath in
 <FileName>XF86Config</FileName>. You can either add the new path(s) with a text
 editor, or use the <Command>chkfontpath</Command> command: 

</Para>

<Para>
 <Literal>
 # chkfontpath --add /new/font/path
 </Literal>

<Para>
 The FontPath must exist before running <Command>chkfontpath</Command>. The

<Title>Getting the Fonts Ready</Title>

<Para>
 We still have a bit of work to do before we can actually use any TrueType
 fonts. xfs requires a few things to be in order. First, all font files must
 have lower case names for xfs. Secondly, they shouldn't have embedded spaces.
 And then, we will need to create a couple of files to make things go.

   </LiteralLayout>
  </MSGText>

</Para>


<Para>
 Note the punctuation -- the backquotes are important! Remove any spaces from
 font names too. Once the TrueType fonts are properly installed, you must 
 create both <FileName>fonts.dir</FileName> and
 <FileName>fonts.scale</FileName> files. The following commands do this: 

</Para>

<Para>
 <Literal>
  <MSGText>
   <LiteralLayout>
 # ttmkfdir -o fonts.scale
 # mkfontdir
   </LiteralLayout>
  </MSGText>

<Para>
 You should now have <FileName>fonts.dir</FileName> and 
 <FileName>fonts.scale</FileName> files in your TrueType font
 directory. <Command>ttmkfdir</Command> is in the 
 <FileName>Freetype</FileName> RPM, and must be run 
 before <Command>mkfontdir</Command>. With Debian based distros, there  
 is a similar utility called <Command>mkttfdir</Command>, and is in the 
 <Filename>fttools</FileName> Deb package. Though this apparently does not 
 generate as many encodings as <Command>ttmkfdir</Command>. These commands
 may not always report errors, so verify that they were created and are not
 empty files:

</Para>

<Para>
 <Literal>
  <MSGText>
   <LiteralLayout>

   </LiteralLayout>
  </MSGText>
 </Literal>
</Para>


<Para>
 If you encounter any problems, try <Command>ttmkfdir</Command> with the 
 <Command>- m</Command> switch. This will discard bad characters from the 
 font file. Specify a number such as 50 or l00 
 (<Command>ttmkfdir -m 50</Command>).  The files themselves are text files.

<Title>xfsft</Title>

<Para>
 <Ulink url="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/jec/programs/xfsft/">xfsft</Ulink>
 is a TrueType solution from Juliusz Chroboczek. xfsft is based on the 
 FreeType font library as developed by Mark Leisher and others. It is 
 essentially is a patch for XFree86's xfs and related libraries -- xfs + ft.
 Redhat's xfs is essentially xfsft with a few minor modifications. Also,
 XFree86 4.x includes the <Literal>freetype</Literal> font module which is also
 the result of Juliusz's work, and is one of the TrueType solutions available
 for XFree86 4.x.

</Para>

<Para>
 Building xfsft requires having at least some of the XFree86 source available, 
 in addition to xfsft itself, so this is not for the faint of heart.
 Instructions for building and configuring xfsft are in the tarball, so I won't 
 go into details here. They are pretty straight forward. There are links to 
 binaries available at the xfsft home page (see above).
</Para>

<Para>
 Note that you <emphasis>must</emphasis> also create
 <FileName>fonts.scale</FileName> and <FileName>fonts.dir</FileName> files for
 xfsft. <FileName>fonts.scale</FileName> can be created manually (ugh!), or with
 the <Command>ttmkfdir</Command> utility. This is not included with xfsft but
 you can get it here:  <ulink
 url="http://www.joerg-pommnitz.de/TrueType/ttmkfdir.tar.gz">http://www.joerg-pommnitz.de/TrueType/ttmkfdir.tar.gz</ulink>,
 or probably on many Linux archives sites too. Redhat has this as part of the
 <FileName>Freetype</FileName> RPM. And for Debian it is called
 <Command>mkttfdir </Command> and is in the <Filename>fttools</FileName>
 package.


</Para>

<Para>
 You will also need a configuration file. Here is a sample:

</Para>

<BlockQuote>

<Title>The fonts.alias File</Title>

<Para>
 <FileName>fonts.alias</FileName> is yet another font configuration file that 
 can be used to tweak how fonts are handled. Like <FileName>fonts.scale</FileName> 
 and <FileName>fonts.dir</FileName>, <FileName>fonts.alias</FileName> must be in
 the same directory as the fonts you are aliasing. It is not mandatory however,
 but does solve certain potential problems.Here is an example from the first
 line of<FileName>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/fonts.alias</FileName> on 
 a Redhat system:
</Para>

<Para>
 <Literal>

   </LiteralLayout> 
  </MSGText>
 </Literal>
</Para>

<Para>
 <Literal>fixed</Literal> is the 'alias' here. Any time this is requested, we 
 actually get the font definition from the second column. Font too small? Just 
 change the definition. (Warning: this is a critical file, at least on Redhat.)
 The same principle applies to all fonts, including TrueType. In fact, if you 
 don't have TrueType, you could conceivably use this trick to have a
 comparable Type 1, or other, font aliased as a TrueType.
</Para>

<Para>
 <FileName>fonts.alias</FileName> is important for some applications that don't
 handle the data provided by <FileName>fonts.scale</FileName> well. Most notably 
 here is Netscape. Without a <FileName>fonts.alias</FileName> you will find that 
 Netscape will only show point sizes of 0 and 12 available.
 <FileName>fonts.alias</FileName> fixes this. You might also find that if you a 
 specify another size with the <Literal>scalable font</Literal> option under 
 <Literal>Preferences</Literal>, Netscape will not remember this setting.
 Annoying! This is also fixed. So we really need this file. Sample excerpt from
 a <FileName>fonts.scale</FileName>:

 There should be two columns all on one line, without the <Quote>\</Quote>, and
 separated by at least one space.) This will keep Netscape happy. Also, if
 font names should have embedded spaces, then you should enclose the filename
 in quotes. You might also note the <Literal>pointsize</Literal> discrepancy
 between the first and second columns of the first few rows. The first column
 of the first entry has a '6', whereas this is aliased to a '9' in the second
 column, and thus '9' point. This is by design and is an excellent way to
 overcome the Netscape 'damn tiny fonts' syndrome. Adjust to suit your tastes,
 resolution, and eyesight.

 This file can be created manually with a text editor, or conceivably with some 
 fancy sed or awk scripting. There is an excellent discussion of this file,
 and other font related topics at Kristin Aanestad's site  at 
 <Ulink url="http://home.c2i.net/dark/linux.html#ttf">http://home.c2i.net/dark/linux.html</Ulink>. There is
 also a link to a python script which can reportedly automatically generate
 a <Filename>fonts.alias</FileName> file at this same site. Thanks to Kristin
 whose work and insight was the inspiration for this section!

<Title>XFree86 4.x</Title>

<Para>
 <Ulink url="http://www.xfree86.org/4.0/">XFree86 4.0</Ulink> 
 introduced native support for TrueType fonts, along with other new
 features. The enhanced font support is based on xfsft from Juliusz
 Chroboczek, which in turn is based on the FreeType font library originally
 from Mark Leisher, so the configuration is similar to xfsft and Redhat's
 patched xfs.

</Para>

<Para>
 The <Literal>FontPath</Literal> is still in <FileName>XF86Config</FileName>, as 
 always. For Redhat 6/7 using a stock XFree86 4.x (i.e. NOT the Redhat 7.x
 supplied version), this will mean moving the Redhat xfs
 <Literal>FontPath</Literal> from <FileName>/etc/X11/fs/config</FileName> back
 to <FileName>XF86Config</FileName>. A separate font server is no longer
 needed just for TrueType support. You may disable it, unless it is needed to
 serve fonts to other clients in a network environment. See the section below 
 for Redhat 7.x specific configuration issues.

 You also must to create <FileName>fonts.scale</FileName> and

<Title>Redhat 7.0 Differences</Title>

<Para>
 Redhat 7.0 introduces some changes to X configuration over previous Redhat
 versions. It is also different from the stock XFree86 configuration as 
 addressed above. Notable differences:
 
</Para>
 
 <Para>
  <ItemizedList>

  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    Both XFree86 3.3.6 and 4.01 are included. If upgrading you may wind up 
    with 3.3.6. The X configuration file is <Filename>XF86Config</FileName> for
    3.3.6 and <Filename>XF86Config-4</FileName> for 4.x. Of course, you'll need
    to know which is which for editing and configuration purposes. 
   
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 
  
  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    xfs is still handling all font duties. A default Redhat 7.x installation
    does not use the 'modules' section of XF86Config. Instead it relies on xfs. 
    This is different from a stock installation of XFree86 4.x where the X server 
    does all the font work -- including TrueType.
 
   </Para>
  </ListItem> 
 
  <ListItem>
   <Para>
    The socket for xfs is "unix/:7100" with RH 7.x, as opposed to "unix/:-1" in

<Title>KDE</Title>

<Para>
 KDE is one of the best things that have happened to Linux and X in a
 long time.  It provides a consistent user interface that goes a long
 way towards making Linux accessable to the average non-geek.  More
 information about KDE can be found at
 <Ulink URL="http://www.kde.org/">http://www.kde.org/</ULink>. So why am
 I singing it's praises here?  This is because KDE 1.1 has a new feature
 that will make the fonts and colors in your programs, including non-KDE
 applications consistent with KDE's current style.
</Para>



<Sect3>
<Title>Applying KDE Fonts and Colors to non-KDE Applications</Title>

<Para>
 This is very easy.  Simply start up the KDE Control Center, go to
 Desktop, and go to Style inside Desktop.  In there, there will be a
 toggle switch labled "Apply fonts and colors to non-KDE apps".  Turn it
 on, click OK, and your done!  The next time you start up many X
 applications, they will use the same colors and fonts that your KDE
 applications do.  Some people may like this feature better than others,
 but if you don't like it you can always turn it off.

<Sect2>
<Title>Netscape</Title>

<Para>
 Let's face it, Netscape is an important application in Linux. We all use it,
 and we all need it, so let's look at it specifically for a minute. An out of
 the box Netscape installation is prone to the font problems we've discussed --
 large fonts that get pixelized, splotchy looking fonts, fonts so small they
 are unreadable. In short, ugly. Maybe this is why you are here?

</Para>

<Para>
 Hopefully, at this point you have followed the above suggestions. These steps
 can help greatly. TrueType font availability is almost a necessity, and you
 need a TrueType font server for this. Many web pages specify font families --
 like Arial -- that are not typically available to Linux users. This is bad
 design, but having some of the basic TrueType fonts available will help
 greatly in overcoming the short-sightedness of some designers. Microsoft --
 can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em.

</Para>

<Para>
 Assuming you have TrueType working, from the Netscape menu select
 <Literal>Edit -> Preferences -> Fonts</Literal>.  Open the <Literal>Variable
 Width Font</Literal> droplist on the right side of the window. Your TrueTypes
 should be there along with other fonts. Choose which ever one suits your fancy
 as the default. Check the <Literal>Allow Scaling</Literal> checkbox too. If
 the available point sizes are 0 and 12, you can go down and, and enter your
 desired point size in the box to the right and click on the
 <Literal>OK</Literal> button. The downside to this is that Netscape will not
 remember these settings, and you will have to do this each time you start
 Netscape. <Emphasis>Unless</Emphasis> -- you have
 <FileName>fonts.alias</FileName> set up already.  Then this will solve these
 problems. See <Xref LinkEnd="falias"> for more on <FileName>fonts.alias</FileName>.

</Para>

<Para>
 You might consider experimenting with some <FileName>~/.Xdefaults</FileName> (or 
 perhaps it's<FileName>~/.Xresources</FileName> on your system) settings too:
</Para>

<BlockQuote>
 <Para>
  <Literal>
   <MSGText>
    <LiteralLayout>
 Netscape*DocumentFonts.sizeIncrement: 10
 Netscape*documentFonts.xResolution*iso-8859-1: 120
 Netscape*documentFonts.yResolution*iso-8859-1: 120
    </LiteralLayout>
   </MSGText>
  </Literal>
 </Para>
</BlockQuote>

<Para>
 The 'sizeIncrement' controls how much of a jump Netscape makes when different
 'basefont' sizes are specified ala:

</Para>

<Para>
 <Literal>
 &lt;basefont size=7&gt;
 </Literal>
</Para>

<Para>
 for instance. The default is '20', which is a pretty good jump. Changing this
 can help Netscape from scaling to too large and too small of a font. The x and
 y resolutions are roughly equivalent to 'dpi' settings. Any random number
 within reason can be used here. Experiment. 

</Para>

<Para>
 Then run: 
</Para>

<Para>
 <Literal>
 $ xrdb -load ~/.Xdefaults
 </Literal>
</Para>

<Para>
 (or <FileName>.Xresources</FileName> as the case may be) and restart Netscape.
 There are many settings that can be tweaked or altered this way. Look at the
 <FileName>Netscape.ad</FileName> (app defaults) file that should be included
 with Netscape packages.
</Para>

<Para>
 If this approach does not get the job done as far as the 'tiny fonts' problem
 in Netscape, then see the <Filename>fonts.alias</FileName> section above. You
 can really fine tune many things with this approach. 

</Para>

<Para>
 Mozilla configuration should be roughly the same. You might find, however,
 that Mozilla does a better job of handling fonts in X, and pages will look
 better overall.

   Unfortunately there is no unified font handling system for Linux. You will have
   to configure each individual program so you can use TrueType, Type 1 or fonts 
   that pique your fancy. And each program may well have its own way of doing
   this so you will have to RTFM.

   Most GUI apps should be able to use TrueType, and Type 1 fonts too. 
   Wordperfect for Linux, however, cannot use TrueType. (See the 
   links section below for more on Wordperfect.) Text editors, terminal programs
   and the like need fixed width fonts, and do not play well with TrueType or
   other scalable fonts.

   Though not discussed here, Type 1 fonts provide many of the same benefits
   as TrueType. You likely have many of these installed already. Unfortunately
   however, Type 1 are not a web standard like TrueType. But they are suitable
   for many other purposes. They are where it's at for printing. See <Ulink
