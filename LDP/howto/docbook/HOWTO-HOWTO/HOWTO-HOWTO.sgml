Purpose / Scope of this HOWTO
</title>
<para>
This document was started on Aug 26, 1999 by Mark F. Komarinski after two day's worth of frustration getting tools to work. If even one LDP author is helped by this, then I did my job. 
</para>

The newest version of this can be found on my homepage <ulink url="http://www.cgipc.com/~markk">http://www.cgipc.com/~markk</ulink> in its SGML source. Other versions may be found in different formats at the LDP homepage <ulink url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">http://www.linuxdoc.org</ulink>.  
</para>
<para>
There are many ways to contribute to the Linux movement without actually
writing code.  One of the most important is writing documentaiton, allowing
each person to share their knowledge with thousands of others
around the world.  This HOWTO is designed to help you get familiar with how
the LDP works, and what tools you'll need to write your own HOWTO.

The Linux Documentation Project (LDP) is working on developing free, high
quality documentation for the GNU/Linux operating system.
The overall goal of the LDP is to collaborate in all of the issues of Linux
documentation. This includes the creation of "HOWTOs" and "Guides". We hope to
stablish a system of documentation for Linux that will be easy to use and
search. This includes the integration of the manual pages, info docs, HOWTOs,
and other documents.

Introduction to the LDP and SGML
</title>
<sect2>
<title>
The LDP
</title>
<para>
The Linux Documentation Project (LDP) was started to provide new users a way of
getting information quickly about a particular subject. It not only contains a
series of books on administration, networking, and programming, but has a large
number of smaller works on individual subjects, written by those who have used
it. If you want to find out about printing, you get the Printing HOWTO. If you
want to do find out if your Ethernet card works with Linux, grab the Ethernet
HOWTO, and so on. At first, many of these works were in text or HTML. As time
went on, there had to be a better way of managing these documents. One that
would let you read it from a web page, a text file on a CD-ROM, or even your
hand-held PDA. The answer, as it turns out, is SGML. 
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>
SGML
</title>
<para>
The Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) is a language that is based on
embedding codes within a document. In this way, its similar to HTML, but there
is where any similarities end. The power of SGML is that unlike WYSIWYG
(What You See Is What You Get), you don't define things like colors, or font
sizes, or even some kinds of formatting. Instead, you define elements
(paragraph, section, numbered list) and let the SGML processor and the end
program worry about placement, colors, fonts, and so on. HTML does the same
thing, and is actually a subset of SGML. SGML has really three parts that make
it up. First is the Structure, which is what is commonly called the DTD, or
Document Type Definition. The DTD defines the relationship between each of
the elements. The DocBook DTD, used to create this document, is an example of
this. The DTD lists the rules that the content must follow. Second is the DSSSL
or Document Style Semantics and Specification Language.  The DSSSL tells the
program doing the rendering how to convert the SGML into something that a human
can read.  It tells the renderer to convert a &lt;table&gt; tag into 14 point
bold if it's going to RTF format, or to turn it into a &lt;h1&gt; tag if
you're going to HTML.  Finally there is the Content, which is what gets
rendered by the SGML processor and is eventually seen by the user. This
paragraph is content, but so would a graphic image, table, numbered list,
and so on. Content is surrounded by tags to separate out each element. 
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>
Why SGML instead of HTML or other formats?
</title>
<para>
SGML provides for more than just formatting. You can automatically build
indexes, table of contents, and links within the document or to outside. The
Jade and OpenJade packages also lets you export (I'll call it render from here
on) SGML to LaTeX, info, text, HTML, and RTF. From these basic formats, you
can then create other formats such as MS Word, PostScript, PDF and so on.
Programs like LyX allow you to write in TeX format, then export it as SGML
and render from SGML to whatever you chose. In the end, SGML is more concerned
about the way elements work instead of the way they look. A big distinction,
and one that will let you write faster, since you don't have to worry about
placement of paragraphs, font sizes, font types, and so on.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>
For New Authors
</title>
<para>
If you are a new to the LDP and want to pick up an unmaintained HOWTO or write a new HOWTO or mini-HOWTO document, contact the HOWTO coordinator at <email>ldp-discuss@lists.linuxdoc.org</email>. This is to make sure the HOWTO coordinator can know who is working on what documentation.
</para>
<para>
Once that part is complete, you may write your documentation in the format
of your choice and submit a draft to <email>ldp-submit@lists.linuxdoc.org</email>
and the draft will be reviewed by an LDP volunteer.  In a few short days you'll
get the draft and comments from the volunteer.  After applying the comments,
you may send this version to the ldp-submit list again for final submission
into the LDP.
</para>
<para>
At this point, another LDP volunteer will translate your document into
DocBook and send you the finished DocBook document.  From here on, all
submissions to the LDP has to be in DocBook format.  If you have markup
questions, you may ask the volunteer who assisted you, or ask the
LDP Docbook list.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>
Mailing Lists
</title>
<para>
There are a few mailing lists to subscribe to so you can take part in how the LDP works. First is <email>ldp-discuss@lists.linuxdoc.org</email>, which is the main discussion group of the LDP. To subscribe, send a message with the subject reading &quot;subscribe&quot; to <email>ldp-discuss-request@lists.linuxdoc.org</email>. To unsubscribe, send an e-mail with the subject of &quot;unsubscribe&quot; to <email>ldp-discuss-request@lists.linuxdoc.org</email>. 
</para>
<para>
Another list is the <email>ldp-docbook@lists.linuxdoc.org</email> list, which 
is for markup or other questions about DocBook itself.  If you run into
trouble with a particular markup tag, you can send your question here
for answers.  You can subscribe to the docbook list by sending a "subscribe"
message to <email>ldp-docbook-request@lists.linuxdoc.org</email>.

The tools
</title>
<para>
In this section, we will cover some of the tools that you'll need or want to
use to create your own LDP documentation. I'll describe them here, and better
define them later on, along with how to install them. If you use some other
tool to assist in writing LDP, please let me know and I'll add a blurb here
for it.

</para>
<para>
The Document Style Semantics and Specification Language tells jade how to
render a SGML document into print or online form. The DSSSL is what converts
a title tag into an &lt;H1&gt; tag in HTML, or bold, 14 point Times Roman for
RTF, for example. Documentation for DSSSL is located at <ulink url="http://nwalsh.com/docbook/dsssl/db152d.zip">http://nwalsh.com/docbook/dsssl/db152d.zip</ulink>.
Note that modifying the DSSSL doesn't modify DocBook itself. It merely changes
the way the rendered text looks. The LDP uses a modified DSSSL that provides
for a table of contents.

Jade
</title>
<para>
Jade and OpenJade are two of the programs that do most of the rendering and
validation of code based off the DTD and DSSSL. One of the following is

</para>
<para>
This is the successor to the sgmltools project, which has officially been
disbanded for over a year. Since then, Cees de Groot has created a slightly
different project, which acts as a wrapper to the jade SGML processor. It
hides much of the ugliness of syntax. This author was able to install the old
sgmltools package followed by the sgmltools-lite and could format this
document quite easily. There's even a man page for sgmltools showing syntax.

<para>
May be Red Hat specific - <ulink url="http://www.redhat.com/">http://www.redhat.com/</ulink>
</para>
<para>
Red Hat distributes three packages, starting with the 6.2 release, that include 
DocBook support and some tools. The tools are easily installed, allowing you to
focus more on writing than wrestling with the tools. TeTex, Jade, and
Jadetex must be installed first.  All three of these packages are available on
the installation CD.

LyX

<para>
<ulink url="http://www.lyx.org/">http://www.lyx.org/</ulink>
</para>
<para>
LyX provides the power of writing SGML with the ease-of-use of a regular word processor. It's not a WYSIWYG program, but more WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) application, since what you see on the screen isn't necessarily what happens after the SGML processor is done with it. The display that LyX provides is similar to, but not exactly like, what the output from jade would look like. However, it's close enough for you to see the flow of the document. Sections and subsections are numbered and put in bold, and different fonts are used to signify things like &lt;code&gt; or &lt;url&gt; tags. Most tags are hidden from the main LyX window while you edit, since LyX writes in TeX, then exports the TeX to SGML.

Optional - <ulink url="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~lenst/about_psgml/">http://www.lysator.liu.se/~lenst/about_psgml/</ulink>
</para>
<para>
Emacs has an SGML writing mode called psgml. Anyone with experience writing in this mode is welcome to e-mail the author of this document. psgml is a major mode in Emacs designed for editing SGML and XML documents. It provides &quot;syntax highlighting&quot; or &quot;pretty printing&quot; features that make SGML tag stand out, a way to insert &quot;tags&quot; other than typing them by hand, and the ability to validate your document while writing.
</para>
<para>
For users of Emacs, it's a great way to go, and many believe it to allow more
versatility than any other SGML documentation tool. It works with DocBook,
LinuxDoc and other DTDs equally well.

<para>
This book was released by O'Reilly in October 1999, and is a great reference
to DocBook. I have not found it to be a great practical book, and much of the
emphasis is on XML, but the DocBook tags for version 3.1 are all listed in a
handy format. You can pick it up at the book vendor of choice. The entire book
is also available online (in HTML and SGML formats) at the above URL.

<para>
Install Jade, DocBook DTD, and DSSSL such that the base of each is under <envar>$_toolroot</envar> (creating <filename class=directory>$_toolroot/jade-1.2.1</filename>, <filename class=directory>$_toolroot/dtd</filename>, <filename class=directory>$_toolroot/dssl</filename>)
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
You'll need to set the <envar>SGML_CATALOG_FILES</envar> environment
variable to the catalogs that you have under
<filename class=directory>$_toolroot</filename>. You can do this with the command:
<command>bash$ export SGML_CATALOG_FILES = $_toolroot/dtd/docbook.cat:$_toolroot/dsssl/docbook/catalog:$_toolroot/jade-1.2.1/dsssl/catalog</command>
</para>

sgmltools
</title>
<para>
Unlike previous versions of sgmltools, you will require sgmltools version 2.x for use with DocBook. Since the backend programs have all changed, you'll also need to forget the sgml2xxx style of programs (sorry). Since some major distributions ship with sgml 1.x, you'll need to remove the sgml 1.x package and install either a 2.0 version, or a CVS version. To get the latest CVS source code version, you can use the following set of commands: 
</para>
<programlisting>
bash$ CVSROOT=:pserver:cvs@cvs.sgmltools.org:/home/cvs
bash$ export CVSROOT
bash$ cvs login
bash$ cvs -z6 get sgmltools
</programlisting>
<para>
The CVS password is 'cvs'. Once downloaded, You can just use 
</para>
<programlisting>
bash$ ./compile 
bash$ make
bash# make install
</programlisting>
<para>
    to install sgmltools. For Red Hat-based systems (using RPM) you can use the rpmfind command to get the latest sgmltools. The rpmfind program is available at
 <ulink url="http://www.rpmfind.net">http://www.rpmfind.net/</ulink>. Make sure you get sgmltools and not sgml-tools, as the latter is sgml-tools 1.0.9. For Debian-based systems, apt-get will retrieve the right package for you: 
   </para>
   <programlisting>
bash# apt-get install sgmltools
   </programlisting>
   <para>
    As with the RedHat, be sure to get sgmltools and not sgml-tools.

<note>
  <title>If you write SGML by hand</title>
  <para>
  SGML has over 300 tags, and uses tags much more heavily than HTML.  It's
recommended that you use an existing HOWTO as a template and see how
other authors have written.  It's also recommended that you use a user-friendly
editor like PSGML or WordPerfect for Windows, as it lists many of the tags
that are available.

   Writing SGML using PSGML

   <sect3>
    <title>
    Introduction
   </title>
   <para>
    If you have installed a recent distribution, you may already have PSGML installed for use with Emacs. To check, start Emacs and look for the PSGML documentation (
<keycombo>
  <keycap>C</keycap>
  <keycap>h</keycap>
</keycombo>
<keycap>i</keycap>
<keycap>m</keycap>
<keycap>psgml</keycap>
).
   </para>
   <para>
    From here on, we assume you have PSGML installed for use with a recent version of GNU Emacs. If that all went by too fast for you, see the free chapter from Bob Ducharme's SGML CD book: <ulink url="http://www.snee.com/bob/sgmlfree/">http://www.snee.com/bob/sgmlfree/</ulink>.

    Updating your .emacs to use PSGML
   </title>
   <para>
    If you want GNU Emacs to enter PSGML mode when you open a <emphasis>.sgml</emphasis> file and be ready for SGML editing, make sure PSGML can find the DocBook DTD. If your distribution already had PSGML set up for use with GNU Emacs, you probably do not have to do anything to get this to work. Otherwise, you may need to set an environment varialbe that tells PSGML where to look for the SGML catalog (the list of DTDs).
   </para>
   <para>
    For example:
   </para>
   <programlisting>
bash$ export SGML_CATALOG_FILES=/usr/lib/sgml/catalog
   </programlisting>
   <para>
    Then add something like the following to your .emacs file:
   </para>

<title>Including Images</title>
<para>
If you plan on including images in your HOWTOs, you can now do this, as LinuxDoc didn't support images.  Here's a sample way of including an image in your HOWTOS:
</para>
<programlisting>
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;title&gt;LyX screen shot&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;mediaobject&gt;
&lt;imageobject>
&lt;imagedata fileref="lyx_screenshot.eps" format="eps">
&lt;/imageobject>
&lt;imageobject&gt;
&lt;imagedata fileref="lyx_screenshot.jpg" format="jpg"&gt;
&lt;/imageobject&gt;
&lt;textobject&gt;
&lt;phrase&gt;Screen shot of the LyX document processing program&lt;/phrase&gt;
&lt;/textobject&gt;
&lt;/mediaobject&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
</programlisting>
<para>
This is a better way than using &lt;graphic&gt; for two reasons.  First,
&lt;graphic> will be removed in DocBook 5.0 in favor of the &lt;mediaobject&gt;
tag.  So you may as well get started with the right way now.  Second,
mediaobject allows for different kinds of media based on what the output is.
In this example, the first &lt;imageobject&gt; is an encapsulated PostScript
(eps) file for use with formats derived from TeX such as DVI, PS, and PDF.  
The second &lt;imageobject> is a JPEG image for visual display, mostly for
HTML output. The &lt;textobject&gt; is presented if the output doesn't support
graphics (TXT).  Think of it as an &lt;alt&gt; tag.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Naming separate HTML files</title>
<para>
By default, when separate HTML files are made, the SGML processor will assign
rabitrary names to the resulting files.  This can be confusing to readers
who may bookmark a page only to have it change, or so you know what files
are what.  Whatever your reasoning, here's how to make separate files named
the way you want:
</para>
<para>
In your first &lt;article&gt; tag (which should be the only one) include an id
parameter and call it index.  This will make your tag look like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
&lt;article id="index"&gt;
</programlisting>
<para>
On the first &lt;sect1&gt; tag, do not modify it, as it's usually an
introduction and you want that on the first page.  For each other &lt;sect&gt; tag, include the id parameter and name it.  Names should include only
alpha-numeric characters, and it should be short enough to understand what it
is.
</para>
<programlisting>
&lt;sect1 id="tips"&gt;
</programlisting>

</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Using ldp.dsl</title>
<para>
The LDP uses its own DSSSL file, which adds things like a white background and
automatic generation of the table of contents you see at the beginning of 
HOWTOs.  You can the latest copy of the file at
<ulink url="http://metalab.unc.edu/gferg/ldp/ldp.dsl">http://metalab.unc.edu/gferg/ldp/ldp.dsl</ulink>.
</para>
<para>
Once you have the file, you may need to do some editing of the first few lines
based on the location of your DocBook DSSSL files.  My example uses the Cygnus
toolset.
</para>
<para>
Place the <filename>ldp.dsl</filename> file in
<filename class="directory">/usr/lib/sgml/stylesheets</filename>
and bring it up under your favorite text editor.
You should see something like this:
</para>
<informalexample>
<screen>
&lt;!DOCTYPE style-sheet PUBLIC "-//James Clark//DTD DSSSL Style Sheet//EN" [
&lt;!ENTITY % html "IGNORE">
&lt;![%html;[
&lt;!ENTITY % print "IGNORE">
&lt;!ENTITY docbook.dsl SYSTEM "docbook.dsl<co id="html">" CDATA dsssl&gt;
]]&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY % print "INCLUDE">
&lt;![%print;[
&lt;!ENTITY docbook.dsl SYSTEM "docbook.dsl<co id="print">" CDATA dsssl>
]]&gt;
]>
</screen>
<calloutlist>
<callout arearefs="html">
<para>
Change this to read <filename>/usr/lib/sgml/stylesheets/nwalsh-modular/html/docbook.dsl</filename>

<para>
Change this to read <filename>/usr/lib/sgml/stylesheets/nwalsh-modular/print/docbook.dsl</filename>
</para>
</callout>
</calloutlist>
</informalexample>
<para>
If you're using another DSSSL, point those two files to the location of the
HTML and print DSSSL files.  They're usually in directories called html and print.
</para>
<para>
With that complete, you can now generate HTML files:
</para>
<programlisting>
bash$ mkdir HOWTO-HOWTO ; cd HOWTO-HOWTO
bash$ jade -t sgml -ihtml -d /usr/lib/sgml/stylesheets/ldp.dsl\#html ../HOWTO-HOWTO.sgml
</programlisting>
<para>
The first command creates a new directory to put your files into.  The second command (the jade one) generates individual HTML files for each section of your
document.  If you're going to something like RTF, you can do this:
</para>
<programlisting>
bash$ jade -t rtf -d /usr/lib/sgml/stylesheets/ldp.dsl HOWTO-HOWTO.sgml

 </title>
 <para>
  The LDP is in the process of providing CVS access to authors. There are a few good reasons for this:
 </para>
 <orderedlist>
  <listitem>
  <para>
  CVS will keep an off-site backup of your documents. In the event that you hand over a document to another author, they can just retrieve the document from CVS and continue on. In the event you need to go back to a previous version of a document, you can retrieve it as well.
  </para>
 </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para>
  It's great if you have many people working on the same document. You can have CVS tell you what changes were made while you were editing your copy by another author, and integrate those changes in.
  </para>
 </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para>
  Keeps a log of what changes were made. These logs (and a date stamp) can be placed automatically inside the document when you use some special tags that get processed before the SGML processor.

  Can provide for a way for a program to automatically update the LDP web site with new documentation as it's written and submitted. This is not in place yet, but is a potential goal. Currently, CVS updates signal the HOWTO coordinator to update the LDP web page, meaning that if you use CVS, you're not required to e-mail your SGML code.

   Getting a CVS account
  </title>
  <para>
   First you'll need to get an account at the LDP's CVS Repository. This is pretty much the root directory that is used by CVS, with various projects (HOWTOs, mini HOWTOs, etc.) created as subdirectories of that.
  </para>
  <para>
   You will need to create a hashed password and userid for your account. The hashed password allows you to send an encrypted password to the CVS group without them needing to know your password. You can do this with the following command, from bash (or sh): 
  </para>
  <programlisting>
bash$ echo your_password | perl -e "print crypt(&lt;&gt;, join '',('.', '/', 0..9, 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z')[rand 64, rand 64]),\"\n\"" 
  </programlisting>
  <para>
   Take the output of this command, and send it with your proposed userid to <email>cvsadmin@cvslist.linuxdoc.org</email>. Your unique CVSROOT will be created and you'll get an e-mail with a response. When you get your response, log into your CVSROOT and make sure everything is set up properly: 
  </para>
  <programlisting>
bash$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:your_userid@cvs.linuxdoc.org:/cvsroot
bash$ cvs -d $CVSROOT login 
  </programlisting>
  <para>
   (Replace the <emphasis>your_userid</emphasis> with what you were sent in the response e-mail). 
  </para>
  <para>
   You will be asked for your password, and then given access to the CVS Repository in read-write mode. Once you've used cvs login once and have been given access to the system, your password is stored in .cvsroot and you will not have to use cvs login again. Just set the CVSROOT and continue on. You can get the entire linuxdoc repository with this command:
  </para>
  <programlisting>
bash$ cvs get LDP
  </programlisting>
  <para>
   Or you can get the SGML source for your own document with these commands:
  </para>
  <programlisting>
bash$ cvs get howto/YOUR-HOWTO.sgml
bash$ cvs get minihowto/YOURDOC.sgml

   <programlisting>
bash$ cvs -d :pserver:cvs@anoncvs.linuxdoc.org:/cvsroot login

   Updating files and CVS

   CVS has a special tag that you can use to automatically insert the date and version directly into the document. This is called <emphasis>$Id$</emphasis>. By including this tag in your document, you can have that automatically change each time you change the file, allowing the revision mark to increment each time. 
  </para>
  <para>
   When you're ready to upload changes to the CVS server, use the command <command>cvs ci -m &quot;comment&quot; YOUR-HOWTO.sgml</command>. The -m &quot;comment&quot; isn't necessary, but if you don't include it, you'll be brought into the editor (usually vi, or whatever your <envar>EDITOR</envar> environment variable is) and be given the chance to add a comment about the changes.

   Before you distribute
  </title>
  <para>
   Before you distribute your code to millions of potential readers there are a few things you should do. 
  </para>
  <para>
   First, be sure to spell-check your document. Most utilities that you would use to write SGML have plug-ins to perform a spell check. If not, there's always the aspell program.
  </para>
  <para>
   Second, get someone to review your documentation for comments and factual correctness. The documentation that is published by the LDP needs to be as factually correct as possible, as there are millions of Linux users that may be reading it. If you're part of a larger mailing list talking about the subject, ask others from the list to help you out. 
  </para>
  <para>
   Third, create a web site where you can distribute your documentation. This isn't required, but is helpful for people to find the original location of your document.

   Copyright and Licensing issues
  </title>
  <para>
   In order for an LDP document to be accepted by the LDP, it must be licensed to allow for free (as in beer) distribution and publishing. As an author, you may retain the copyright and add other restrictions (for example, you must approve any translations or derivative works). A sample license is available at <ulink url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/COPYRIGHT.html">http://www.linuxdoc.org/COPYRIGHT.html</ulink>. If you choose to use the boilerplate copyright, simply copy it into your source code under a section called &quot;Copyright and Licenses&quot; or similar. Also include a copyright statement of your own (since you still own it). If you are a new maintainer for an already-existing HOWTO, you must include the previous copyright statements of the previous author(s) and the dates they maintained that document.

   Submission to LDP
  </title>
  <para>
   Once your LDP document has been reviewed by a few people and you took into account their comments, you can release your document to the LDP. Send an e-mail with the SGML source code as an attachment (you may gzip it if you like) to <email>ldp-submit@lists.linuxdoc.org</email>.
  </para>
  <para>
   Be sure to include the name of your HOWTO in the subject line, and use the body to outline changes you've made and attach your HOWTO. This allows the maintainers to do their jobs faster, so you don't have to wait for your HOWTO to be updated on the LDP web site. If you don't hear anything in 7 calendar days, please follow up with an e-mail to make sure things are still in process. 
  </para>
<para>
If your HOWTO contains extras, such as graphics or a special catalog, create a
.tar.gz file with all the files in it including the .sgml source code and mail
it as an attachment to the ldp-submit list.

  FAQs about the LDP

   <title>
   I want to help the LDP. How can I do this?
  </title>
  <para>
   The easiest way is to find something and document it. Also check the unmaintained HOWTOs and see if there is a subject there that you know about and can continue documenting.

   <title>
   I want to publish a collection of LDP documents in a book. How is the LDP content licensed?
  </title>
  <para>
   Please see <ulink url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/COPYRIGHT.html">http://www.linuxdoc.org/COPYRIGHT.html</ulink>. Note that this is only a guideline to authors. However, the licensing cannot be more restrictive than what is listed in that URL.

   I found an error in an LDP document. Can I fix it?
  </title>
  <para>
   Contact the author of the document, or the LDP coordinator at <email>ldp-discuss@lists.linuxdoc.org</email>and mention the problem and how you think it needs to be fixed.

  <title>But I don't know SGML/Can't get the tools working/Don't like SGML</title>
  <para>
  That's okay.  You have the option of writing your first draft of the HOWTO in
the format of your choice, then submit that to the LDP.  An LDP volunteer will
review the document, then convert it into DocBook for you.  Once that's done,
it will be easier for you to maintain the HOWTO.  If you run into questions,
you can always drop a line to the LDP volunteer or the LDP Docbook list at
<email>ldp-docbook@lists.linuxdoc.org</email>.
