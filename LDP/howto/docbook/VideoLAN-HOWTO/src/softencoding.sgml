<chapter id="softencoding"><title id="tsoftencoding">Stream from an acquisition card</title>

<note><para>This feature is available on Linux only.</para></note>

<sect1><title>Install the Video for Linux drivers</title>

<para>If you want to stream from an acquisition card, a
video4linux driver must be available for it. You can find more
information about video4linux and supported devices <ulink
url="http://www.exploits.org/v4l">here</ulink>.</para>

<para>Compile the right module for your device, and insert it into
your kernel (Some video4linux modules are shipped with the 2.4.x Linux
kernels). You can test your device by using any of the listed programs
in the <emphasis>Video: TV and PVR/DVR</emphasis> section of <ulink
url="http://www.exploits.org/v4l/">this page</ulink>.</para>

<para>Note that v4l2 modules will also work with VLC.</para>

<sect1><title>Stream with VLC</title>

<note><para>This feature is not available in vlc 0.5.3, but it is in
CVS.</para></note>

<note><para>If you're building vlc from sources, you must specify
<command>--enable-v4l</command> to <command>./configure</command> to use
this feature.</para></note>

<prompt>% </prompt><userinput>vlc v4l:/dev/video:channel=0:frequency=8052:norm=secam:size=vga --sout udp:192.168.0.42 --ttl 12</userinput>
</screen>

<para>where :</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para><filename>/dev/video</filename> is the device
corresponding to your acquisition card,</para>

<listitem><para><emphasis>frequency, norm and size</emphasis> are
parameters passed to your card,</para>

<listitem><para><emphasis>192.168.0.42</emphasis> is either :</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>the IP address of the machine you want to unicast to ;</para>
<listitem><para>or the DNS name the machine you want to unicast to ;</para>
<listitem><para>or the multicast IP address.</para>
</itemizedlist>


<listitem><para><emphasis>12</emphasis> is the value of the TTL (Time To
Live) of your IP packets (which means that the stream will be
able to cross 11 routers).</para>

</itemizedlist>

</sect1>

<sect1><title>Stream with VLS</title>

<note><para>When you compile VLS, you must do a <command>./configure
--enable-v4l --with-ffmpeg=PATH</command> (where
<emphasis>PATH</emphasis> si the absolute path to the directory where
you compiled ffmpeg, and not the relative path !).</para></note>

<para>There is no command line interface for this input for the
moment... so you will have to use the configuration file.</para>

<para>Here is a typical configuration file <filename>vls.cfg</filename>
for a v4l device :</para>

<programlisting>
