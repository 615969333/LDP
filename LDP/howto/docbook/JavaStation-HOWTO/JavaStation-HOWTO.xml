The HOWTO author wishes to give a second thank-you to Pete

</para>
 
<blockquote>
<attribution>Robert Dubinski, March 2000</attribution>

<para>
Pete got me going with <application>Linux</application> on the 
<productname>JavaStation</productname> in December 1998, has 
been the main kernel programmer adding in support for the 
<productname>JavaStation</productname> line, and despite his busy 
work schedule was nice enough to find time to answer all my email 
queries for help over the last 15 months. 
</para>

<para>
Eric worked on bringing <application>X</application> support to the 
<productname>JavaStation</productname> when it had none.
He had been working on a dedicated server for the <productname>
JavaStation</productname> in early 1999, and kept me informed of 
his progress.  In mid-1999, he switched tactics and sent a working 
framebuffer example to test out.  He also wrote the first comprehensive 
mini-HOWTO for the <productname>JavaStations</productname>, 
answered my email questions, and got me interested in the embedded
solution which I employ here at Marquette.

Thank-you Pete and Eric!

<title>Definition of an <acronym>NC</acronym> including the Differentiation 
from <acronym>PC</acronym>'s</title>

<para>
A network computer, or <acronym>NC</acronym>, was hailed as 
"the next big thing" in computing from late 1995 to early 1998.  
Conventional <acronym>PC</acronym>'s, called "fat clients", were 
expected to be minimized in businesses by thin-client 
<acronym>NC</acronym>'s. 
</para>
 
<para>
Thin-clients get their <acronym>OS</acronym>, applications, and data 
files entirely through the network.  They are different from 
dumb-terminals;  they run full-scale graphical applications.  
Thin-clients are also different than graphical X-terminals.  
X-terminals typically run an X server and display the client programs of 
a remote server.  Thin clients generally run full-scale graphical 
programs locally, such as a web browser, a <application>Java</application> 
application, or a <quote>legacy-connectivity program</quote>, which enables 
the thin-client to display <application>X</application> apps or 
<application>MS Windows</application> apps which run on more
powerful servers. 
</para>
 
<para>
Advantages of <acronym>NC</acronym>'s include:

<para>
This model is the second most prevalent <productname>JavaStation</productname> 
model you are likely to find.  When you talk to industry folks about the 
<quote>JavaStation</quote>, this is typically the model remembered first.  
Delayed numerous times, the <productname>Krups</productname> model 
officially went on sale to the general public Mar. 26, 1998 at the annual 
JavaOne conference. 
</para>
 
<para>
Though generation two of the <productname>JavaStation</productname> line, the 
<productname>Krups</productname> model was <emphasis>the JavaStation</emphasis>
.  Sporting a completely different board design than <productname>JavaStation-1
</productname>, <productname>Krups</productname> establishes what was to be 
the characteristic <productname>JavaStation</productname> architecture. 
</para>
 
<para>
<productname>Krups</productname> is powered by a 
<hardware>100Mhz MicroSPARC IIep</hardware> chip, (note the 'p'). 
Its mainboard had the internal addition of a <hardware>PCI bus</hardware>, 
about a year before this standard bus made its well-publicized 
appearance on the <productname>Sun Ultra</productname> workstation 
line. The <productname>Krups</productname> <hardware>motherboard</hardware> 
is Sun Part no. <productnumber>501-4267</productnumber>.
</para>
 
<para>
<productname>Krups</productname> keeps the <hardware>PS2 keyboard</hardware> 
and <hardware>PS2 mouse ports</hardware> from <productname>JavaStation-1
</productname>, keeping in mind the low-cost, interoperable goal of 
generation 1. 
</para>
 
<para>
With the new board design, came new memory chip sockets.  Instead of
<hardware>SIMMs</hardware>, the <quote>tower</quote> moved to <hardware>
168-pin DIMMs</hardware>.  <hardware>DIMMs</hardware> had begun to make 
their way from the workstation realm to <acronym>PC</acronym>'s in the 
time between generations one and two of the <productname>JavaStation
</productname> line, so it was fitting for Sun to switch to
it in anticipation of their status low-cost commodity memory chips. The
<hardware>DIMMs</hardware> accepted by the <quote>tower</quote> are 
<hardware>168pin, 3.3V unbuffered EDO DIMMs (not SDRAM)</hardware>.  With 
two sockets capable of holding a <hardware>32MB DIMM</hardware> each, the 
<productname>Krups</productname> has a maximum capacity of 64<acronym>MB
</acronym> <acronym>RAM</acronym>. As with the <productname>JavaStation-1
</productname>, the number <quote>xx</quote> in the Sun option number 
refers to the amount of memory shipped with the unit. 
</para>
 
<para>
For video display, the <productname>JavaStation-NC</productname> utilizes 
the <hardware>PCI-based IGS C1682 framebuffer</hardware>, 
capable of 1280x1024@80Hz in 24-bit <quote>true color</quote>.  This 
is a step up from the 8-bit display on <productname>JavaStation-1
</productname>.  The port connector remained a <hardware>standard VGA jack
</hardware> like <productname>JavaStation-1</productname>, enabling the 
user to use standard <acronym>PC</acronym> monitors if desired.
The on-board audio remains a <hardware>Crystal 
CS4231 chip</hardware> like <productname>JavaStation-1</productname>. 
The network interface on <productname>Krups</productname> is the 
<hardware>Sun HappyMeal</hardware> 10/100 Mbps interface, another step 
up from the original offering of <productname>JavaStation-1</productname>.
</para>
 
<para>
The <quote>tower</quote> came with the <hardware>9-pin serial port
</hardware> and <hardware>1/8" audio out jack</hardware> as 
<productname>JavaStation-1</productname>, but it also added a 
<hardware>1/8" audio-in jack</hardware>, to do sound recording with. 
</para>
 
<para>
Another addition in the <productname>JavaStation-NC</productname> is a 
<hardware>flash memory SIMM</hardware>.  This allows one to load the 
current revision of the <acronym>OS</acronym> onboard, increasing 
boot-speed tremendously. 
</para>
 
<para>
Perhaps the thing most memorable about the <productname>JavaStation-NC
</productname> is its case design.  The <productname>Krups</productname> 
comes in an aesthetically appealing casing.  The <hardware>mainboard</hardware> 
is mounted vertically, and the shell entraps it, giving it the <quote>tower
</quote> or <quote>percolator</quote> shape referred to.  With the 
streamlined case, the <hardware>power supply</hardware> is moved outside 
to small transformer.  The <productname>Krups</productname> unit gives 
off so little heat that there are no onboard cooling fans, making the 
<productname>Krups</productname> a <emphasis>dead-silent</emphasis> 
machine.  Imagine the difference in noise when replacing a lab of 
traditional desktops with the <productname>Krups</productname>!  
This case design earned <productname>Krups</productname> a<quote>
1998 Industrial Design Excellence Award</quote> from the Industrial 
Designers Society of America.  This award announcement is archived

<para>
The <productname>Krups</productname> had an initial base price of $599US, 
$100US cheaper than <productname>Mr. Coffee</productname>'s rollout price.  
Due to it being the only model formally sold by Sun to the general public, 
this is how <productname>Krups</productname> is sometimes referred to as 
the only <productname>JavaStation</productname>, and not one model of a

<title>
<productname>JavaStation-E</productname> [<quote>Espresso</quote>] 
[Sun Option No. JE-xx]
</title>
 
<para>
This model is extremely rare to find.  It was never available for
sale in quantities to either the general public or the initial 
<productname>JavaStation</productname> deployments, limiting the
model's production quantity.  To call this <quote>Generation 
Three</quote> of the <productname>JavaStation</productname>
may be improper, as <productname>Espresso</productname> is nothing like 
the generation three <productname>JavaStation</productname> written about 
in early Sun marketing literature. 
</para>
 
<para>
The <productname>Espresso</productname> was designed as an extension of 
the <productname>Krups</productname>.   It was geared to sites that 
wanted a little bit more functionality and expansion capability from 
their <productname>JavaStations</productname>: a cross between an 
<acronym>NC</acronym> and a workstation.
</para>
 
<para>
<productname>Espresso</productname> is powered by the same 
<hardware>110Mhz MicroSPARC IIep chip</hardware> as <productname>Krups

with the addition of <hardware>PCI slots</hardware> and an <hardware>IDE 
channel</hardware> for local hard disks.  The <hardware>IDE</hardware> on 
<productname>Espresso</productname> was not enabled in the demo units.
Those who have tried to make it work have concluded the wiring is incorrect,

The maximum amount of memory for Espresso is reported to be 96MB. 
As with the <productname>Mr. Coffee</productname> and <productname>Krups

The <quote>Dover</quote> <productname>JavaStation</productname> model
</title>
 
<para>
This is another box which does not exist officially outside of Sun.  
Little was known of it at the first revision of this HOWTO.  Since then,
proud owners have stepped forward.  Basically, the Dover takes the Espresso 
theme and moves it to stock X86 parts.  
</para>

<para>
Dover comes in a case similar to the Espresso, but there's nothing where
the 'JavaStation-E' tag would be.  Dover can be situated in a vertical
position by removable feet.  All that is printed on the case is "Sun
MicroSystems 1998", and typically a serial number sticker of '12345678'
and 'Made in Taiwan'.
</para>

<para>
The motherboard is 'baby ATX' in configuration, but not
quite totally.  Near the the front of the case is a fan that points
at the CPU heat sink.  The CPU heat sink has anothe fan on top of it. 
The motherboard has a Socket 7 CPU socket that houses a Cyrix MediaGCm-266GP
CPU.  There are typical PC motherboard jumpers with silk-screened legends 
for setting both clock speed and multiplier.  The motherboard accepts
a PC100 DIMM (max. size unknown) and a powersupply with AT-type power
connectors.  Included among them are two floppy and regular hard
drive type plug.  There are two small jumpers going to the motherboard,
JPSB1 and JAUTO1, possibly for power management.
</para>

<para>
Expansion in Dover is via a two-card riser, with one PCI and one shared
PCI/ISA slot.  As mentioned earlier, the motherboard deviates slightly from
standard ATX. Along the back edge under the cards are
connectors for audio out, audio in, mic, HD15F video, two USB ports, 
D25F parallel printer, stacked PS/2 keyboard/mouse ports, and four
9-pin serial ports, marked A through D.  Unlike other JavaStation models,
there is no on-board ethernet.  Instead, it typically is provided by a 
supplied 3COM 3C905B-TX Fast Etherlink XL PCI card (with a wake-on-LAN 
cable going to the motherboard).  There is a standard Sun MAC address 
label on the back of the case.
</para>

<para>
Video is via a Cyrix CX5530 chip, but with the MediaGX chip, may be
just an auxilliary chip.  There exist both a FDD and HDD headers on the
motherboard, but nowhere to mount a FDD in the case and no provision
for an HDD bracket either.  There is a simple piezo buzzer mounted to 
the motherboard and additionally a speaker with a cable leading back 
near the audio out jacks.  Like the Espresso, there is a smart-card 
reader as well, and what looks like a compact-flash socket inside.
</para>

<para>
When booting it up, you get a blue JS screen.  Under the
exclamation point, are two memory card icons and a &lt;...&gt; 
icon.  It reads:

The Dover model, since it is based on an x86 chip, is supported by Linux.

presented here <emphasis>will not work</emphasis> with it.  However, 
there's plenty of x86 documentation out there to go off of.

<title>
The Generation 3 <quote>Super JavaStation</quote>
</title>
 
<para>
Sun originally envisioned three generation models of the <productname>
JavaStation</productname>: <productname>Mr. Coffee</productname>, the 
<productname>Krups</productname>, and the <quote>Super JavaStation</quote>.   
Generation Three was billed in early literature as going to be the fastest 
<productname>JavaStation</productname> offerred, with a high-speed 
<hardware>CPU</hardware> and a <hardware>JavaChip co-processor</hardware> 
to translate <application>Java-bytecode</application> in hardware.
</para>

<para>
All indications are that it never got beyond the mental stage,
and was more of a marketing myth than anything else. 
</para>

<para>
First, consider that the cost of higher performance <acronym>CPU</acronym> 
as a factor.  If Sun packaged a high-performance <acronym>CPU</acronym> into 
a <productname>JavaStation</productname>, the low-cost advantage of an 
<acronym>NC</acronym> goes away.
</para>

<para>
Next, Sun did have their <hardware>PicoJava chip</hardware> available to 
decode <application>Java bytecode</application>, but rumor is the performance 
was not as good as expected, and the <hardware>JavaChip</hardware> project 
was shelved in the Summer of 1998, not long after <productname>Krups
</productname> was formally released. 
<!-- <Comment>ed note: verify date.</Comment> -->
The <quote>Dover</quote> project was being worked on, but the <quote>Corona
</quote> project, which would go on to become the <productname>Sun Ray
</productname>, was the final nail in the <productname>JavaStation</productname>
's coffin.

The Pre-Mr. Coffee JavaStation Prototype
</title>
 
<para>
After the original publishing of this HOWTO, word of one more 
"JavaStation" model surfaced.  John of bodoman.com, a reseller 
of JavaStation equipment, chimed in that he has a motherboard of a 
pre-JavaStation machine.  It was made by Diba Corporation, which was 
later bought out by Sun.  The unit was released as an early embededded 
Java platform that developers could use to build embedded Java machines. 
It has a Motorola 68030 CPU, 14.4k bps modem, ethernet interface, 
standard VGA interface and even a TV output.  The prototype's date is
circa 1996.

The Pre-Mr. Coffee JavaStation/Fox
</title>
 
<para>
After receiving word of the JavaStation prototype from Diba, yet
more information has come regarding another pre-Mr. Coffee model.
This one though, has a greater known history we can share here.
</para>

<para>
This model was the JavaStation development box used by the developers
of early JavaStation software.  Basically it was a SS4/110 in a smaller,
custom case similar to the Mr. Coffee enclosure, with more squarish profile.  
</para>

<para>
The case has an off-white color with lateral stripe in Sun gray.  It
sits like a Mr. Coffee would on its side.  The front was a 1/2 cyclinder i
design in Sun  gray, has the Sun Logo, the word "Sun" under that, and the 
Java cup logo at the bottom.  
</para>

<para>
When booting up it claims to be a "JavaStation/Fox".  The motherboard 
does not have a normal Sun part number.  The CPU is a microSPARC-II running
at 110MHz.  The box has an onboard external SCSI connector,
dual A and B serial ports, audio in and out sound ports (Crystal 
Semiconductor 4231, 
lance ethernet network interface, onboard PCMCIA (stp4020), one SBUS expansion
slot, one AFXbus expansion slot, 2 72-pin SIMM slots (double-banked SIMMs
only), and no on-board video.  One would then add their own S-Bus frame 
buffer, or the 24-bit frame buffer from a ss5.  Also, an optional internal 
SCSI laptop hard drive could be put in.
</para>

<para>
The motherboard's part number is 501-2785.  The CPU is dated 1995 while the
NCR chips are dated 1994, establishing the time frame of the Fox.

Well, of course the old JavaStations were practically
unusable.  It's not a matter of just my opinion; we used to
have CU 310 full of students using the Xterms all the time.
As soon as the JavaStations appeared there were NO STUDENTS
in there at all.  The JavaStations killed CU 310.  Now that
the JavaStations are (thanks to you) back up to speed,
students are beginning to come back, but they've gotten out
of the habit of working in our lab, and are used to working
on their own in the dorms.  I think this is a big loss --
they don't learn anything from talking to each other in the
labs anymore.
</para>
<para>
Ghostview was slow, etc, but even vi was too slow.  I am
used to typing quickly, and when the cursor can't keep up
with me, I can't handle it.  I would also have worked at home
if I didn't have to be here.  And there were those annoying
red squares left all over the Xterm window when you were in
vi.  I had to type ^L every few lines to get rid of them to
see what I was typing...  The pits.  The whole setup made
me lose a lot of respect for Sun (although I try to separate
the different product lines as much as possible);  I also
think Sun will not get respect for hyping a product like the
JavaStation so strongly, and then just dumping it.  I would
wonder why anyone would not just dump Sun...

BTW, the JavaStations, now that they are fast, are quite fine.
I really like mine, and don't see why they aren't a viable
product.

<para>
I believe that it was the triple combination of Sun's JavaOS, the 
Hotjava software, and GraphOn's GoJoe X-connectivity software which 
ultimately doomed the JavaStation line. 
</para>
 
<para>
JavaOS was always sluggish in performance for us.  It was rated as
having one of the slowest Java VMs by a ZDNet Online Magazane review at
<ulink url="http://www.zdnet.com/pcmag/features/javaguide/jfgr10.htm">
http://www.zdnet.com/pcmag/features/javaguide/hfgr10.htm</ulink>
.  I speculate this was the the main cause of delaying the 
JavaStation's formal public release to April 1998.   
</para>

<para>
JavaOS also always lagged behind the current Java developer 
spec (ie running Java 1.0 when Java 1.1 was prevalent, and Java 1.1 
when Java 1.2 was issued).  It was tough explaining to students why
the books they were buying were all using the new event-model of Java 1.1,
but they could not program to it and have it run on <quote>the Java machine
</quote>.  There were also some implementation problems with some of the 
AWT peers which sometimes made programming across
platforms difficult.
</para>

<para>
These performance and implementation problems were never addressed in 
subsequent build of JavaOS for the duration we ran it.  I believe the 
last edition we had used a Java 1.1.4 runtime, when we had a Java 1.2
development kit on the server.
</para>

<para>
The HotJava browser software suffered from not being able to handle 
web standards HTML4, cascading style-sheets, or the ECMA javascript.
All of these standards were employed in commercial sites at the time, 
resulting in many sites that weren't viewable by the JavaStations.  
The Hotjava Browser engine also had serious printing problems with 
certain webpages, some of which appeared on Sun's own website!
</para>

<para>
The HotJava Views task selector software also was rough.  Users could have
multiple apps running, but only one displayed at a time.  Manipulation 
of multiple window panes was difficult (no minimization, no quick list to
all apps, resizing not always possible).  Flexibility users had grown
accustomed to was tossed out in favor of this task-selector approach.
On Sun's Java website there was a page boasting of a committee formed
that decided this was the <quote>right way</quote> to make a desktop.
Tell that to our users.
</para>
 
<para>
The GraphOn Go-Joe software was by far the most damaging piece of software
to the JavaStation line.  This was an X-connectivity software Sun licensed
from GraphOn to give users access to the Solaris servers' X apps.  
The connectivity worked via a daemon installed on the Solaris server, 
which was connected to by a Java connectivity applet on the NC side.  This 
small applet (only about 250K) simply threw up the latest display state 
and sent back to the daemon the mouse and keyboard strokes of the user.  
Unlike Xterminals though, the actual Xserver process was spawned and 
communicated with on the remote server-side by the daemon.  Communication 
between the GraphOn client applet and the server daemon was supposedly 
done by a patented protocol to compress communication and speed things up.
However, the performance of X under Go-Joe was terribly sluggish, with 
horrible refresh rates (10-seconds for some page scroll refreshes).  
Many sites operators I spoke to elected to not run the Go-Joe software 
past a trial period for this reason.  We had to run it though, as our 
users were heavily X dependant.  Alternatives like Weird/X were not 
available at this time, and VNC proved not up to snuff given the slow 
JavaOS VM.
</para>

<para>
This performance in Go-Joe alone was enough to give uninformed users the
impression that the JavaStation was an underpowered machine, especially 
when placed side-by-side with the low-cost, end-of-lifed Sun Xterminal 1 
hardware it was meant to replace.  Our students left labs in droves, 
faculty were upset, and giving demos to outsiders was downright 
embarrassing.  In reality the hardware was solid and stable, but 
was hampered by this new, untested OS and new, untested applications 
running on a new, untested hardware architecture.   This triple-threat 
combination, and Sun's timeline for fixing the problems is what 
I feel truly doomed the JavaStation.
</para>
 
<para>
I remember that in 1998, Sun publicized that it had rolled out 3000 
of these machines in-house, including one on Scott McNealy's desk.  
One who has used the JavaStations with the Sun software would have 
to wonder whether he ever turned it on and used it solely for a day?  
Had he done so, I'm sure he'd demand things be done differently.  
Why Sun never ported and released its tried and tested XTerminal 
software to the JavaStation, or even a mini-Solaris, remained a 
mystery to us the whole time before we switched to Linux.  It was
only after we moved to Linux and the JavaStation line was formally killed
by Sun when we learned from some inside Sun sources that Solaris 
actually was ported to Mr. Coffee, but released only internally at Sun.  
As a heavily invested customer site who had begged for help, this was 
not only disheartening, but insulting to discover.
</para>
 
<para>
Lastly, the customer support we received at the time was horrible.  We pled
our case on more than a few occassions, but requests always seemed to
fall on deaf ears.  Calling up SunSolve for JavaStation help always
resulted in a transfer to a Java <emphasis>Language</emphasis> engineer.  
If the Sun employees do not know their own products, that's a problem!
</para>

<para>
>From our view, there no doubt was politics involved in this, and as
customers, we were the ones to bear the results of this.
We continue using Sun equipment when it comes to the proven models 
like the Enterprise-class servers and diskarrays, but on the 
latest low-cost desktop offerings, we will be forever cautious 
given the JavaStation history.
</para>

<para>
Linux now proves the JavaStations are adequate machines, and Sun could 
take this bait and go with it.  If they sell the JavaStations for $250 
a piece and the JavaStation running a proven OS like Linux (or Solaris) 
with proven apps (X), the JavaStation makes for a great network appliance.  
The recent NetPliance I-Opener Linux hack and subsequent controversy 
proves there certainly is a market for this type of low-cost device.

<para>
Mr. Coffee is the most widespread JavaStation model, and has tended
to sell around $50US consistently for the last year or so.  Krups
models more rare and sell at higher prices, probably because the 
stylish case still stands out today.  Many reports have come from 
the UK telling of many Krups models getting dumped there, while 
numerous Dover sitings are now being reported from South Africa.   
The Espresso and JavaEngine models are near impossible to find.

<title>Necessary Patch for <quote>Embedded-Root</quote> FS Configurations</title>

If you have decided to go with the <quote>Embedded-Root</quote> filesystem

driver source first. 
</para>
 
<para>
The default size of a <acronym>RAM</acronym> disk when using the <acronym>RAM
</acronym>disk driver is 4 <acronym>MB</acronym>.  Chances are that you will 
want an embedded filesystem of more than that size, particularly when you 
start thinking about running an <application>X server</application>, or 
including a <application>Java</application> runtime. 
</para>
 
<para>
You can do this change by yourself, or by using the patch pointed to below.
The change is a one-line edit in the file 
&lt;LINUXROOT&gt;/drivers/block/rd.c .  Look for a line that says: 
</para>
 
<screen>
int rd_size = 4096; /* Size of the RAM disks */ 
</screen>
 
<para>
and change it to the size of the <acronym>RAMdisk</acronym> you wish.  
Typically, most embedded systems are under 16 <acronym>MB</acronym>, so 
a common edit is to change the line to: 
</para>

<title>Preparing Yourself to Build Your Own Filesystem</title>

Building a filesystem for use with the <productname>JavaStations

filesystem and add desired functionality. 
</para>
</listitem>

</orderedlist>
 
<para>
Which path you take, of course, is entirely up to you.  The <quote>rescue 
disk</quote> build procedure seems to work best though, as more base 
commands in a rescue disk are statically linked, increasing the starting
image size but causing less initial library headaches.
</para>
 
<para>
Obviously when building a filesystem in the context of the <productname>
JavaStation</productname>, you will be basing off of an existing 
<application>Linux/SPARC</application> filesystem.  The filesystems
that come with the RedHat and Debian distributions are good starting 
points.
</para>


<warning>

In the future, you will also need to make sure you base off a filesystem

One thing to keep in mind is that unlike your <quote>NFS-Root</quote>

within the confines of your allocated <acronym>RAM</acronym>disk,

<title>Setting up for Boot with <acronym>TFTP</acronym></title>
<para>
Now we need to set up the last step on our server: the <acronym>TFTP
</acronym> configuration.  For this step, you will need the kernel 
you created (using the <quote>NFS-Root</quote> option) or the 
piggybacked kernel/fs boot image (using the <quote>Embedded-Root</quote> 
option), the appropriate <application>PROLL</application>, and some 
knowledge of hexadecimal numbering.

Now, you create of symbolic link from the hexidecimal version of your 
<acronym>IP</acronym> to your <application>PROLL</application> image, 
and a map from <quote>HEXIP.PROL</quote> to your real kernel image.  If 
you are using <quote>Embedded-Root</quote> option, you point to your 
<quote>Embedded-Root</quote> Filesystem plus Kernel image.  If you are 
using the <quote>NFS-Root</quote> option, you need to point to the 
normal <quote>vmlinux.aout</quote> image, plus have a separate map of 
<acronym>IP</acronym>-&gt;nfsroot location.  For sake of completeness, 
you might also want a <quote>HEXIP.SUN4M</quote> -&gt; <quote>HEXIP
</quote> map, as that is the custom way of dealing with net boot 
situations with the Sun.

<title>What to See When Booting Linux</title>

<para>
When you boot things properly, your JavaStation will start up with
the normal white background screen with the PROM banner at the top,
and you will get the black "exclamation mark in triangle" logo, 
signalling the system doesn't yet know who it is.    When contact is
made with the DHCP server, the logo goes away and changes to the
Java coffee cup logo.  After this, a black background window opens.
This is the PROLL window.  It'll show status of the TFTP download in
progress, and give stats on the size of the file downloaded.  Next,
the whole screen should go black, you should see a picture of Tux the
penguin in the upper left hand of the screen, and have the
normal Linux kernel messages printed before you.  Any mistakes from
this point are due to the filesystem you are using, the filesystem
mounting, or missing kernel drivers which should have been compiled
in.

I reported this problem to Sun in November 1999, at which time I was
told a fix was not scheduled to be made, since I was using an
<quote>unsupported configuration.</quote>.   Never mind the client
was a piece of hardware made by Sun itself.  Also never mind that
indirect <acronym>XDMCP</acronym> queries is a standard itself which
was broken by Sun.  A call back in late January 2000, and I learn that
the record of my previous call was non-existant, but a fix was now on
its way. The fix finally was made available in April 2000, five months
after first reporting the problem.  Considering revisions to this

With the great embedded-root solution for the JavaStations, the question

While there are some x86 NICs that have boot roms on them, you'd also need

this currently is not possible as the piggyback program looks for a header
specific to the SPARC platform. (28-Apr-2000)

set in the wrong input device mode.  To rectify this, you need to enable
the openboot prom prompt as described elsewhere in this HOWTO, and then
set the 'input-device' directive accordingly.  Or, as one contributor
did before the OBP setting was discovered, load up NetBSD on your 
JavaStation and run the eeprom command there.  Convoluted, but it 
works too.

I am not responsible for any direct or indirect damages to your
equiment or yourself resulting from you reading this document.
USE THIS INFORMATION ON YOUR OWN RISK.

IDE interrupt line is connected "upside down" on the Espresso.
To have IDE working we need to insert an invertor in it.
We borrow the invertor from ISA IRQ3. If you want to use ISA
modem, set it to use COM3/IRQ4 (please realize that Linux IRQ
level would be programmed in CPU PCIC).

The following picture provides an overhead view:

    Z (pullup)               R1208
    !
    *

I recommend to proceed in the following way:

1. Disconnect 1202 5 & 6. Not knowing if I need them I lifted pins with a
model knife. You may just cut them with side cutters.

2. Lift pins 1200 10 & 11 but do not cut them!

3. Run wires from resistor pads "A" to pin 1200 11 and from pad "B" to
   pin 1200 10. Resistor pads are much easier targets for soldering at home
   than pads under pins 1202 5 & 6. I am a software engineer, so I did it
   the easy way.

   I did not bother to glue wires as a decent electronics hacker would do.

   You are all set. Get kernel 2.4, hack drivers/block/Config.in and enjoy!

   P.S. Let me know if you have drawings of hard drive brackets for Espresso.

Javastation Key Combinations

These are the key combinations that allow you to perform the command monitor
functions:
Press left Alt, left Ctrl key, letter; then turn the power on. You have to
have the keys pressed when you turn on the power otherwise it will not work. 

Ctrl-Alt-H Help on chords
