   <title>What is NFS?</title>
    <para>
      The Network File System (NFS) was developed to allow machines 
      to mount a disk partition on a remote machine as if it were on
      a local hard drive.   This allows for fast, seamless sharing of 
      files across a network.
    </para>
    <para>
      It also gives the potential for unwanted people to access your 
      hard drive over the network (and thereby possibly read your email 
      and delete all  your files as well as break into your system) if 
      you set it up incorrectly.  So please read the Security section of 
      this document carefully if you intend to implement an NFS setup.
    </para>
    <para>
      There are other systems that provide similar functionality to NFS.
      Samba provides file services to Windows clients.  The Andrew File
      System from IBM (<ulink url="http://www.transarc.com/Product/EFS/AFS/index.html">http://www.transarc.com/Product/EFS/AFS/index.html</ulink>), 
      recently open-sourced, provides a file sharing mechanism with some 
      additional security and performance features.  The Coda File System 
      (<ulink url="http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/">http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/</ulink>) is still in development as of this writing
      but is designed to work well with disconnected clients.  Many of the
      features of the Andrew and Coda file systems are slated for inclusion
      in the next version of NFS (Version 4) (<ulink url="http://www.nfsv4.org">http://www.nfsv4.org</ulink>).  The 
      advantage of NFS today is that it is mature, standard, well understood, 
      and supported robustly across a variety of platforms.

   <title>What is this HOWTO and what is it not?</title>
   <para>
     This HOWTO is intended as a complete, step-by-step guide to setting
     up NFS correctly and effectively.  Setting up NFS involves two steps,
     namely configuring the server and then configuring the client.  Each 
     of these steps is dealt with in order.  The document then offers     
     some tips for people with particular needs and hardware setups, as   
     well as security and troubleshooting advice.  
   </para>
   <para>
     This HOWTO is not a description of the guts and
     underlying structure of NFS.  For that you may wish to read
     <emphasis>Managing NFS and NIS</emphasis> by Hal Stern, published by O'Reilly &
     Associates, Inc.  While that book is severely out of date, much
     of the structure of NFS has not changed, and the book describes it
     very articulately.  A much more advanced and up-to-date technical 
     description of NFS is available in <emphasis>NFS Illustrated</emphasis> by Brent Callaghan.
   </para>
   <para>
     This document is also not intended as a complete reference manual,
     and does not contain an exhaustive list of the features of Linux
     NFS.  For that, you can look at the man pages for <emphasis>nfs(5)</emphasis>, 
     <emphasis>exports(5)</emphasis>, <emphasis>mount(8)</emphasis>, <emphasis>fstab(5)</emphasis>, 
     <emphasis>nfsd(8)</emphasis>, <emphasis>lockd(8)</emphasis>, <emphasis>statd(8)</emphasis>, 
     <emphasis>rquotad(8)</emphasis>, and <emphasis>mountd(8)</emphasis>.
   </para>
   <para>
     It will also not cover PC-NFS, which is considered obsolete (users
     are encouraged to use Samba to share files with PC's) or NFS 
     Version 4, which is still in development.

   <title>Software Pre-Requisites: Kernel Version and nfs-utils</title>
   <para>
     The difference between Version 2 NFS and version 3 NFS will be 
     explained later on; for now, you might simply take the suggestion 
     that you will need NFS Version 3 if you are installing a dedicated
     or high-volume file server.  NFS Version 2 should be fine for 
     casual use.
   </para>
   <para>
     NFS Version 2 has been around for quite some time now (at least 
     since the 1.2 kernel series) however you will need a kernel version
     of at least 2.2.18 if you wish to do any of the following:
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem><para>Mix Linux NFS with other operating systems' NFS</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>Use file locking reliably over NFS</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>Use NFS Version 3.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   </para>
   <para>
     There are also patches available for kernel versions above 2.2.14 
     that provide the above functionality.  Some of them can be downloaded
     from the Linux NFS homepage.  If your kernel version is 2.2.14-
     2.2.17 and you have the source code on hand, you can tell if these 
     patches have been added because NFS Version 3 server support will be 
     a configuration option.  However, unless you have some particular
     reason to use an older kernel, you should upgrade because many bugs
     have been fixed along the way.
   </para>
   <para>
     Version 3 functionality will also require the nfs-utils package of 
     at least version 0.1.6, and mount version 2.10m or newer.  However 
     because nfs-utils and mount are fully backwards compatible, and because 
     newer versions have lots of security and bug fixes, there is no good 
     reason not to install the newest nfs-utils and mount packages if you 
     are beginning an NFS setup.
   </para>
   <para>
     All 2.4 and higher kernels have full NFS Version 3 functionality.
   </para>
   <para>
     All kernels after 2.2.18 support NFS over TCP on the client side.
     As of this writing, server-side NFS over TCP only exists in the
     later 2.2 series (but not yet in the 2.4 kernels), is considered 
     experimental, and is somewhat buggy.
   </para>
   <para>
     Because so many of the above functionalities were introduced in
     kernel version 2.2.18, this document was written to be consistent
     with kernels above this version (including 2.4.x).  If you have an
     older kernel, this document may not describe your NFS system
     correctly.
   </para>
   <para>
     As we write this document, NFS version 4 is still in development 
     as a protocol, and it will not be dealt with here.
