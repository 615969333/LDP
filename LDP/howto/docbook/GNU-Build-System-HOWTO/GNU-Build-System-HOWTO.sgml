        This HOWTO is a resource for first time users of the GNU
        build tools.  It is intended to be an introductory guide, to
        help you with GNU Make, Autoconf, Automake etc.  It also tries to
        provide an explanation as to to how these tools work.

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>

      If you have installed packages from source on a Unix environment,
      you will have encountered <filename>Makefile</filename>s that are
      used to compile the package.  When there was no Automake or
      Autoconf, it was a non trivial task to get big source packages to
      compile, leave alone getting them to work for you.  It often
      involved tweaking of the <filename>Makefile</filename>s and making
      changes to source.  Another difficult task was to find out what
      were the necessary things that you need (like libraries, the right
      version of the library needed) before you could compile a
      particular package.

    </para>

    <para>

      Another major problem that many software developers face is that
      of maintaining portability and achieving platform independence.
      This is important if the code written needs to run on a variety of
      platforms.  Finding the specifics of a machine and the operating
      system to configure the source of a package for successful
      compilation and working is the problem of interest here.

    </para>

    <para>

      The GNU Autotools address these issues.

      <title>About this Document</title>

      <para>

        This document is maintained by me (Y Giridhar Appaji Nag).  It
        was originally written from the notes that I took down when I
        was learning Automake and Autoconf.  The manuals that come with
        these programs are pretty comprehensive and there are several
        examples as well (and you also have all those nicely made
        source packages).  However, most of these do not explain how the
        tools work.  Also, The Linux Documentation Project did not have a
        document which dealt with this topic.  Hence this document.

    <title>Using the GNU Build Tools</title>

    <para>

      This section of the document introduces various GNU build tools
      and explains how to use them.  Though the treatment would not be in
      depth, it should help you understand the files that these tools
      operate on.  After going though this section of the HOWTO, you
      would be able to read the documents provided here as references
      and experiment with the features that these tools have to offer.

    <sect2 id="make-use">
      <title>GNU Make</title>

      <para>

        If you are reading this document, it is possible that you
        already have prior experience with the Make tool.  However, any
        discussion of the GNU build system and tools would be incomplete
        without a mention of Make.

      </para>

      <sect3 id="make-whatis">
        <title>What is Make</title>

        <para>
        
          Make is a utility for automatic compilation of programs.  It is
          usually used in projects to find out if the files that a
          certain <quote>target</quote> depends on have changed and
          re-generates the target.

        </para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="make-example">
        <title>Make in action</title>

        <para>

          A very minimal <filename>Makefile</filename> would look like:

        </para>

<programlisting>
$ cat Makefile

foo: foo.c
         gcc -o foo foo.c
</programlisting>

        <para>

          The target in this <filename>Makefile</filename> is
          <filename>foo</filename> and it depends on the
          <filename>foo.c</filename> dependancy.  The second line tells
          make how to build the target in case the dependancy changes.

        </para>

        <para>

          A slightly more useful example would be:

        </para>

<programlisting>
$ cat Makefile

default: hw

hw: hello.o world.o
        gcc -o hw hello.o world.o -lm

hello.o: hello.c hello.h
        gcc -c hello.c

world.o: world.c world.h
        gcc -c world.c

clean:
        rm -f hw hello.o world.o
</programlisting>

        <para>

          The target in this <filename>Makefile</filename> (which is the
          first target that appears in the
          <filename>Makefile</filename>) is <literal>default</literal>.
          <literal>default</literal> depends on <literal>hw</literal>
          which inturn depends on <filename>hello.o</filename> and
          <filename>world.o</filename>.  These can be `made' using the
          rules that have been specified for them.  For example,
          <filename>hello.o</filename> is created using the command
          <command>gcc -c hello.c</command> whenever
          <filename>hello.c</filename> or <filename>hello.h</filename>
          are modified.

        </para>

        <para>

          The other target <literal>clean</literal> can be invoked
          explicitly to remove the target files that have been
          generated.

        </para>

<programlisting>
$ make clean
rm -f hw hello.o world.o
</programlisting>

        <para>

          <filename>Makefiles</filename> can also be written using
          variables and wild-cards making them easy to modify.  For
          example, the above <filename>Makefile</filename> could be
          re-written as:

        </para>

<programlisting>
$ cat Makefile

TARGET = hw
OBJS = hello.o world.o
CC = gcc
CCOPTS = -c
LOPTS = -lm

all: $(TARGET)

$(TARGET): $(OBJS)
        $(CC) -o $@ $(OBJS) $(LOPTS)

%.o: %.c %.h
        $(CC) $(CCOPTS) $<

clean:
        rm -rf $(TARGET) $(OBJS)
</programlisting>

        <para>

          Every <literal>$(VARIABLE)</literal> in the
          <filename>Makefile</filename> is replaced with its value.  The
          generic rule <literal>%.o: %.c %.h</literal> <footnote> <para>
          In general, one source file would depend on more than one
          header file and the dependency rule is not as simple as this.
          It is infact difficult to keep track of dependencies on header
          files and their dependencies with nested includes.  There are
          ways of handling this (see the manual page of makedepend on
          your Linux machine and the -M option to gcc), but using
          automake makes this a cakewalk.  </para> </footnote> says that
          each <filename>.o</filename> file is dependant on the
          corresponding <filename>.c</filename> and the
          <filename>.h</filename> files.  <literal>$@</literal> refers to
          the current target and <literal>$&lt</literal> refers to the
          first one among the list of dependencies of the current
          target.  Note that this version of the
          <filename>Makefile</filename> does not need a lot of
          modifications if a single source file and the corresponding
          header files are added.

        </para>

        <para>

          GNU Make has several other interesting features like the VPATH
          directive to locate the source files that are not co-located
          with the <filename>Makefile</filename>, facility for
          sophisticated wildcards etc.  These can be found from the
          <citetitle>official GNU Make manual</citetitle> in <xref
          linkend=resources>.

        </para>

      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="make-gnumakefile">
        <title>A GNU <filename>Makefile</filename></title>

        <para>

          <filename>Makefile</filename>s that go with software packages
          that follow the GNU <filename>Makefile</filename> conventions
          have a few standard targets that provide useful and commonly
          used functionality like:

        </para>

              been included with the package.

            </para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>

            <para>

        </itemizedlist>

        <para>

          and many more ...

        </para>

        <para>

          Writing the dependencies and rules for these targets is a
          non-trivial task and involves some effort.  Automake solves
          this problem by generating all the standard targets.

        m4 is a macro processing language.  It does the seemingly
        un-interesting job of replacing macros with their definitions in
        the input, and copying it to the output.  This is what many
        <quote>pre-processors</quote> do.  It is used with several
        popular software pacakges like the sendmail program (where it is
        used to generate sendmail configuration files) and automake
        (where is it a pre-requisite for generating the configure
        scripts).  m4 has several uses, for instance, it can be used to
        update elements in the webpages of an entire website ensuring a
        standard look and feel.

    <title>PREAMBLE</title>

    <para>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,
    or other written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
    with or without modifying it, either commercially or
    noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
    author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
    being considered responsible for modifications made by
    others.</para>

    <para>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that
    derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the
    same sense.  It complements the GNU General Public License, which
    is a copyleft license designed for free software.</para>

    <para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
    for free software, because free software needs free documentation:
    a free program should come with manuals providing the same
    freedoms that the software does.  But this License is not limited
    to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
    regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
    printed book.  We recommend this License principally for works
    whose purpose is instruction or reference.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="gfdl-1">
    <title>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</title>

    <para>This License applies to any manual or other work that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License.  The "Document",
    below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the
    public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</para>

    <para>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work
    containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
    verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.</para>

    <para>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
    (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</para>

    <para>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections
    whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
    in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</para>

    <para>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that
    are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</para>

    <para>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
    is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed
    and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text
    editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
    or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
    "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>

    <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
    can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
    or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</para>

    <para>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
    the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
    For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
    "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
    the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
    text.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="gfdl-2">
    <title>VERBATIM COPYING</title>

    <para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium,
    either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
    License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this
    License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and
    that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
    License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
    control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
    distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
    copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</para>

    <para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
    above, and you may publicly display copies.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="gfdl-3">
    <title>COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>

    <para>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</para>

    <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</para>

    <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</para>

    <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
    authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
    number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
    updated version of the Document.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="gfdl-4">
    <title>MODIFICATIONS</title>

    <para>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the
    Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided
    that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
    License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the
    Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
    Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition,
    you must do these things in the Modified Version:</para>

    <orderedlist numeration="upperalpha">
      <listitem><para>Use in the Title Page
      (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the
      Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
      there were any, be listed in the History section of the
      Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version if
      the original publisher of that version gives permission.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>List on the Title Page,
      as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for
      authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
      together with at least five of the principal authors of the
      Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than
      five).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>State on the Title page
      the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the
      publisher.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>Preserve all the
      copyright notices of the Document.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>Add an appropriate
      copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other
      copyright notices.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>Include, immediately
      after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public
      permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
      License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>Preserve in that license
      notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover
      Texts given in the Document's license notice.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>Include an unaltered
      copy of this License.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>Preserve the section
      entitled "History", and its title, and add to it an item stating
      at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
      Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If there is no
      section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating
      the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given
      on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
      Version as stated in the previous sentence.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>Preserve the network
      location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a
      Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
      locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
      based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.  You
      may omit a network location for a work that was published at
      least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
      publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>In any section entitled
      "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the section's
      title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of
      each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications
      given therein.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>Preserve all the
      Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and
      in their titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent are not
      considered part of the section titles.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>Delete any section
      entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section may not be included in
      the Modified Version.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>Do not retitle any
      existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with
      any Invariant Section.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    
    <para>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
    or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
    material copied from the Document, you may at your option
    designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
    add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
    Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
    other section titles.</para>

    <para>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
    various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
    the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
    definition of a standard.</para>

    <para>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
    Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the
    end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
    passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
    publisher that added the old one.</para>

    <para>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by
    this License give permission to use their names for publicity for
    or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="gfdl-5">
    <title>COMBINING DOCUMENTS</title>

    <para>You may combine the Document with other documents released
    under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
    modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
    all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
    unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
    combined work in its license notice.</para>

    <para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this
    License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced
    with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
    the same name but different contents, make the title of each such
    section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
    name of the original author or publisher of that section if known,
    or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
    the combined work.</para>

    <para>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
    "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
    entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
    "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
    must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="gfdl-6">
    <title>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</title>

    <para>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and
    other documents released under this License, and replace the
    individual copies of this License in the various documents with a
    single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you
    follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of
    the documents in all other respects.</para>

    <para>You may extract a single document from such a collection,
    and distribute it individually under this License, provided you
    insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
    follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
    copying of that document.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="gfdl-7">
    <title>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</title>
    
    <para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
    separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
    Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
    copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
    called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
    other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.</para>

    <para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
    these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than
    one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts
    may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
    aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
    aggregate.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="gfdl-8">
    <title>TRANSLATION</title>

    <para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
    4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires
    special permission from their copyright holders, but you may
    include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition
    to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may
    include a translation of this License provided that you also
    include the original English version of this License.  In case of
    a disagreement between the translation and the original English
    version of this License, the original English version will
    prevail.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="gfdl-9">
    <title>TERMINATION</title>
    
    <para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
    Document except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any
    other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
    Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
    rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full
    compliance.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="gfdl-10">
    <title>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</title>

    <para>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
    versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
    version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
    concerns.  See <ulink
    url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</ulink>.</para>

    <para>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing
    version number.  If the Document specifies that a particular
    numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to
    it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that specified version or of any later version that has
    been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
    If the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
    you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="gfdl-11">
    <title>How to use this License for your documents</title>

    <para>To use this License in a document you have written, include
    a copy of the License in the document and put the following
    copyright and license notices just after the title page:</para>

<blockquote id="sample-copyright"><para>
      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".
</para></blockquote>

    <para>If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant
    Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have
    no Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
    "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover
    Texts.</para>

    <para>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
    code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
    choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public
    License, to permit their use in free software.</para>
