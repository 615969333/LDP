         This is just the beginning of a draft of the future Anti-Spam HOWTO.
         Stay tuned.

         <para>
          Since this is a mere draft, there are most likely missing sections,
          errors, and other snafus. Please forgive the mess, and check back 
          later.

   This HOWTO will address the impact of SPAM on computer users and networks, 
   both large and small. We will look at the problem, as well as the various
   solutions that are available to Linux administrators and users.

  <para>
   Spam is a four letter word to all of us. For the sake of our discussion, 
   Spam will simply be <emphasis>unwanted email</emphasis> that is targeted at
   a large number of recipients. Often it is commercial in nature (i.e. trying
   to sell you something), but not always.
  </para>
  <para>
   We will not address mass mailings that are the result of viruses, though
   the techniques used to combat spam are often effective with viruses as
   well.
  </para>
  <para>
   And we will confine our discussion to email Spam only.
  </para>
  <para>
   There is a brief Glossary in the appendix should any of the terminology
   used in the document not be clear.
