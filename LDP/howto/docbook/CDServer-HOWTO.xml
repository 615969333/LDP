	The CD Server HOWTO describes the steps and commands you can 
	use to setup your own CD Server using Linux and some built-in 
	Unix commands along with other freely available software packages.  
	The CD Server can then share the CD's via the network to 
	Windows and/or other client machines.

<para>
With disk space becoming less expensive (100GB Western Digital 7200rpm available
for US $195 in January 2002), it is viable to use an Open Source 
software-based CD Server solution, instead of paying 
$800-$4,000 for a software, thin-server, or CD Jukebox solution.

Previous to the 2.4 kernels, the Linux-Mandrake distribution I was using only had
support for 8 loop devices compiled into the kernel (see 
<xref linkend="addloops" /> 
to increase this number).
At that time, you were only be able to share 8 CD's on a network 
with that default value, and to share more than 8, the loop block driver source code (loop.c) needed
to be modified and a new kernel compiled.
</para>
<para><emphasis>With the 2.4 kernels, that is no longer required.</emphasis>
You can now set the number of loop
devices dynamically via the max_loop module parameter, or by passing max_loop=[1-255] 
to the kernel on boot.

<indexterm>
	<primary>cdserver!creating images</primary>
</indexterm>

<para>
Choose (or create) a file system with the largest available disk
space on it.  Keep in mind that CD-ROM's can hold around 640MB of data,
so if you want to share 8 full CD's on your network,
you'll need 5.1GB of space available.
</para>

<para>

<screen>
Login as root or "su" to root.

bash# df -h

Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda5             1.4G   82M  1.3G   6% /
/dev/hda1              15M  827k   14M   6% /boot
/dev/hda7             2.4G 1008M  1.3G  43% /usr
/dev/hda8            23.6G 11.7G 11.7G  50% /home
</screen>

</para>

<para>
Here the /home filesystem has the most available space, so it is the 
most suitable filesystem to use for dumping the CD images to.
</para>

<para>

<screen>
 
bash# cd /home
bash# mkdir image
bash# cd image
</screen>
 
</para>

<para>
Now, copy the CD to an iso image.  You must know the device name 
of your CD-ROM drive (usually /dev/cdrom, it could be /dev/scd0 for 
SCSI CD-ROM's) I'll use the Mandrake distribution CD-ROM as an Example:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
bash# dd if=/dev/cdrom of=mndrk81.iso
</screen>

</para>

<para>
The "if=" is the input file, the "of=" is the output file.  You 
should see a message stating the number of records in and number of 
records out.  If you see i/o errors, they will most likely be due to
the lead-in and lead-out runoutblocks on the CD.  If the number
of records in and number of records out do not match you may have a problem, 
otherwise the image will most
likely be alright, but you can never know if the errors happened while
reading the ISO part of the CD or not (due to dust or scratches on the
CD).  Other utilities to read CD's exist, like <emphasis>readcd</emphasis> or
<emphasis>sdd</emphasis>.  More information about making 1:1 copies of CD's 
exists in the CD-Writing-HOWTO, see <xref linkend="reading" />.
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>My thanks to Giblhauser Carl Michael for the runoutblock information.</emphasis>

<indexterm>
	<primary>cdserver!mounting images</primary>

<para>
The next step is to mount the iso image file.  Let's create 
a directory under /mnt to place the mounted file.
</para>

<para>

<screen>
bash# cd /mnt
bash# mkdir iso
bash# cd iso
bash# mkdir mndrk81
</screen>

</para>

<para>
Now mount the ISO image file to this newly created directory
</para>

<para>

<screen>
bash# mount -o loop,unhide -t iso9660 -r /home/image/mndrk81.iso /mnt/iso/mndrk81
</screen>

</para>

<para>
The "-o loop" means use the option that mounts a file as a block 
device.  The unhide option shows hidden files. The "-t iso9660" means that the file is in the iso9660 CD-ROM 
format.  The "-r" means to mount read-only.
</para>

<para>
	<emphasis>Thanks to Amar Chaouche for pointing out the unhide option for the mount command.</emphasis>
</para>

<para>
Now you can:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
bash# cd mndrk81
bash# ls -al
</screen>

</para>

<para>
You should see a listing (ls) of the files and directories that are on 
the actual CD (only now they're inside the iso image file, and that's 
what you're currently looking at!)
</para>

<!-- section2: System Restart -->

<indexterm>
	<primary>cdserver!editing fstab</primary>
</indexterm>

<para>
Now that we've manually mounted the image, and made sure it works, 
an entry needs to made in the /etc/fstab file so that the image is 
remounted on the next system startup.  It's important to make the 
entry AFTER the entry for the parent filesystem, e.g. /home (I 
use vim, but Emacs, Joe, Pico or Jed will work just as well):
</para>

<para>
<screen>
bash# vim /etc/fstab

<para>
You'll need to have Samba installed and working to perform the next 
steps (that's outside the scope of this instruction).  If it's not 
yet installed, consult your Linux distribution's instructions for 
installing the Samba package.  Or you can visit the Samba website 
at http://us1.samba.org/samba/samba.html for installation instructions, 
binaries, and/or the source code.
</para>

<para>
To share your mounted CD's on a windows network, simply create 
a stanza in the /etc/smb.conf file similar to the following:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
[cdimages]
  comment = All Shared CD Images
  path = /mnt/iso
  public = yes
  writable = no
</screen>
</para>

<para>
This will share all the subdirectories under the /mnt/iso directory 
on the network.  To mount the share to a local drive (in this case 
the I: drive), bring up an MS-DOS Prompt on the Windows machine and 
type the following:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
C:\&#62; net use I: \\yourlinuxmachine\cdimages
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Each CD image will now appear as a subdirectory on the I: drive of 
your Windows machine.
</para>

<para>
To mount ONLY the Mandrake CD image to a drive letter (we'll use M:, 
the root drive of which, will correspond exactly to the CD as if it 
was just inserted in the CD-ROM drive), create the following stanza 
in the /etc/smb.conf file.
</para>

<para>
<screen>
[mndrk81]
  comment = Mandrake Linux 8.1
  path = /mnt/iso/mndrk81
  public = yes
  writable = no
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Then, at your MS-DOS Prompt, mount it with the following command:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
C:\&#62; net use m: \\yourlinuxmachine\mndrk81
</screen>
</para>

<para>

<para>
The Samba smb.conf file stanzas presented here are

a Samba share which limit who can mount the shares, control how 
user authentication is performed, and whether the share is even 
browseable through Network Neighborhood on the Windows machines.

Make sure that NFS is running and configured correctly on

</para>

<para>
<screen>
# sample /etc/exports file
       /mnt/iso            (ro,insecure,nohide,all_squash)
</screen>
</para>

<para>
The nohide option will allow you to mount a parent directory, without
explicitly mounting all exported subdirectories beneath it.  
</para>
<para>
Now try running:
</para>
<para>
<screen>
bash# exportfs -r
</screen>
</para>
<para>
This should re-export everything in your /etc/exports file.

<para>
	Newer Linux kernels (2.4) allow you to add more loop devices easily by
	editing /etc/modules.conf or through the use of a boot parameter.
</para>
<para>
	Older kernels (2.2 ?) only had
	support for 8 loop devices compiled into the kernel.  In short, you were
	only able to share 8 CD's on a network with this default value.
	In order to support more than that default, you needed to modify the kernel source
	and recompile a new kernel.
</para>
<para>
Use the following methods to determine which version of the kernel you are running.
</para>
<para>
<screen>
bash# uname -a

or

bash# cat /proc/version
</screen>
</para>


<!-- section2: Adding Loop Module Option -->

<sect2 id="loopmodule">
<title>Adding the Loop Module Option</title>

<para>
	Current kernels allow you to set the number of loop devices supported
	without recompiling the kernel.  One of these methods is to add an options
	line to /etc/modules.conf.  This method will only work if your loop support
	has been configured as a loadable kernel module (which is how most major
	Linux distributions come preconfigured now).
</para>
<para>
	Edit /etc/modules.conf and add the following line.
</para>
<para>
<screen>
options loop max_loop=64
</screen>
</para>

<para>
	After making the above change, simply reboot.  Or you can try to use
	rmmod and insmod to make the change on the fly - but this will not work
	if you currently have any loop devices mounted (you'll get an error saying 
	loop: Device or resource busy).
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>
	Note: if you do not have an /etc/modules.conf, your module configuration
	file may be called /etc/conf.modules (this name is now deprecated).

<!-- section2: Appending to the Boot Prompt -->

<sect2 id="bootprompt">
	<title>Appending to the Boot Prompt</title>

<para>
	If your loop support has been compiled directly into the kernel (in other words,

	like to support at the linux boot prompt.
</para>

    <title>PREAMBLE</title>

    <para>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,
    or other written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
    with or without modifying it, either commercially or
    noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
    author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
    being considered responsible for modifications made by
    others.</para>

    <para>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that
    derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the
    same sense.  It complements the GNU General Public License, which
    is a copyleft license designed for free software.</para>

    <para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
    for free software, because free software needs free documentation:
    a free program should come with manuals providing the same
    freedoms that the software does.  But this License is not limited
    to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
    regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
    printed book.  We recommend this License principally for works
    whose purpose is instruction or reference.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="1">
    <title>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</title>

    <para>This License applies to any manual or other work that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License.  The "Document",
    below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the
    public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</para>

    <para>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work
    containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
    verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.</para>

    <para>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
    (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</para>

    <para>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections
    whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
    in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</para>

    <para>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that
    are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</para>

    <para>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
    is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed
    and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text
    editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
    or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
    "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>

    <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
    can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
    or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</para>

    <para>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
    the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
    For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
    "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
    the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
    text.</para>

    <title>VERBATIM COPYING</title>

    <para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium,
    either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
    License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this
    License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and
    that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
    License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
    control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
    distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
    copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</para>

    <para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
    above, and you may publicly display copies.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="3">
    <title>COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>

    <para>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</para>

    <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</para>

    <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</para>

    <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
    authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
    number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
    updated version of the Document.</para>

    Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided
    that you release the Modified Version under precisely this

    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.</para>

    <para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to

    <para>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing
    version number.  If the Document specifies that a particular
    numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to
    it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that specified version or of any later version that has
    been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
    If the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
    you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.</para>

    <title>How to use this License for your documents</title>

    <para>To use this License in a document you have written, include
    a copy of the License in the document and put the following
    copyright and license notices just after the title page:</para>

<blockquote><para>
      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".
</para></blockquote>

    <para>If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant
    Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have
    no Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
    "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover
    Texts.</para>

    <para>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
    code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
    choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public
    License, to permit their use in free software.</para>
