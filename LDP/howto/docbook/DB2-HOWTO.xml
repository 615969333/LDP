<para>
This HOWTO gives you explicit instructions on installing
DB2 Universal Database Version 7.1 for Linux
on the following Intel x86-based distributions: Caldera OpenLinux 2.4,
Debian, Linux-Mandrake 7.2, Red Hat Linux 6.2, Red Hat Linux 7.1, 
SuSE Linux 6.2, 6.3, and 7.0, and TurboLinux 6.0.
After installing DB2, you can work with a
sample database, connect to your DB2 server from a remote machine, and
administer DB2 using the DB2 Control Center.

<title>Why a DB2 installation HOWTO?</title>

<para>
Ever since DB2 Version 5.2 was ported to Linux in 1998 and made
available as a beta download, there has been a lot of interest in
DB2 on Linux.  The beta represented one of IBM's first dips into
the waters of Linux, and it generated a lot of feedback.
In fact, if you read through the newsgroups, you still see occasional questions
from people who are trying out the Version 5.2 beta. (I don't know where they're
getting it, but they're out there.) And, not surprisingly,
they run into problems. It was a beta product, after all.
</para>

<para>
Anyway, I've been trying out DB2 on Linux since Version 5.2, so I've
had a chance to witness the improvements over the past couple of years.
I've also made a lot of use of the Linux Documentation Project in that
time, and wanted to contribute something to the <acronym>LDP</acronym>.
So I decided to write about the one thing that I really know something
about on Linux, and hope that it helps someone else out there.
</para>

<para>
DB2 on Linux has come a long way since Version 5.2. The first supported release
of DB2 on Linux was Version 6.1 in 1999, which removed many of the installation
hurdles faced by the Version 5.2 beta testers.
</para>

<para>
DB2 Version 7.1 is the second major release that supports Linux, and since it's
a new release I'm expecting that a new wave of people curious about DB2,
as well as people migrating from Version 6.1, are going to try installing
this new release on Linux.  To that end, I'm writing this HOWTO
to share my experiences and help smooth your installation.

One of the big boosts comes from the standardization on the
IBM Developer Kit for Java, which improves the stability of the
DB2 Control Center and enables application developers to write
stored procedures and UDFs in Java. DB2 Version 7.1 also introduces the
ability to write stored procedures in SQL.
</para>

<para>
As time permits, I hope to provide hints and tips for improving the performance
of DB2 on Linux, and for configuring the environment on various Linux
distributions to be able to build DB2 applications in C, C++, and Java.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Who should read this HOWTO?</title>

<para>
If you plan to install DB2 Version 7.1 on one of the Linux distributions
supported by IBM, this document is for you. The distributions that
IBM officially supports are:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Caldera OpenLinux 2.4
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Red Hat Linux 6.2
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
SuSE Linux 6.2 and 6.3
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
TurboLinux 6.0
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
For Debian and Slackware, I have included <emphasis>very</emphasis> basic installation
instructions or links to other resources in <xref linkend="xfactor"/>. If you have any
other installation success stories, please forward me the details
and I'll try to expand the section. As time permits, I plan to try
to duplicate and confirm these installation instructions.
</para>

<para>
If you install DB2 Version 6.1 for Linux and DB2 hangs on the
<command>db2start</command> command, see
<ulink url="http://www-1.ibm.com/servlet/support/manager?rt=1&amp;rs=0&amp;q=1000814">db2start hangs on Linux distributions built with glibc 2.1</ulink>. I don't include any other DB2 Version 6.1
information in this document. If you plan to install DB2 Version 5.2 on Linux,
<emphasis>don't</emphasis>! (Have I emphasized that point enough?
All right, I'll stop now.) The Personal Developer's Edition
of DB2 Version 7.1 is available as a free (beer) download from IBM, at the
<ulink url="http://www.ibm.com/software/data/db2/udb/downloads.html">DB2
Universal Database download site</ulink>.
Registration is required, and, of course, your copy of DB2 is
only free as long as you don't use it in a production environment.
</para>

<para>
This document is really meant to help you install DB2 Version 7.1
on the previously listed Linux distributions. I've installed
DB2 on all of the distributions supported by IBM and noted the prerequisites and
quirks for each of them. I don't go into detail about the
various features of DB2, or what each installation option means, but
I do cover the basics that you need to know to get it installed.

<title>About the author</title>
<para>
Dan Scott has been employed by IBM Canada as an Information Developer
since 1998&mdash;approximately when DB2 was first ported to Linux. It's
probably just coincidence.
He has documented and tested DB2 application development for the bulk
of that time. In his spare time he can occasionally be found mourning for
his dearly departed motorcycle, abusing his body on his mountain bike,
or contemplating how to upgrade his Linux distribution at home (which
started life as Mandrake 5.3 and has mutated wildly ever since) without
suffering the wrath of his girlfriend.

<para>
Prerequisites are what you, your machine, and your distribution
require before you will be able to successfully install or use DB2.
The required prerequisites come straight from
<citetitle pubwork="book"><ulink url="http://www.ibm.com/cgi-bin/db2www/data/db2/udb/winos2unix/support/v7pubs.d2w/main">IBM DB2 Universal Database for UNIX Quick Beginnings</ulink></citetitle>.
The suggested prerequisites come from experience.
For your convenience, I've divided them into hardware and software requirements.
</para>

<title>Hardware prerequisites</title>
<varlistentry>
<term>Processor</term>
<listitem>
<para>x86 compatible (for example, Intel, AMD, or Cyrix).
I've successfully installed DB2 Version 7.1 on a Pentium Pro 200 and a
Pentium II 350. Your experiences with other x86 processors would be
appreciated.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>Memory</term>
<listitem>
<para>For application development, I've found 96 MB of
<acronym>RAM</acronym> is enough to run a small database
and test out your applications. Even the Control Center
responds acceptably if your processor speed is fast
enough. In my case, I was working with a Thinkpad 600 equipped
with a Pentium 233 MMX processor and 96 MB of RAM.
However, more memory is recommended if you're putting your
database into production or running multiple services.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>Free disk space</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Of course, this depends on the components you install,
but for a typical installation of the DB2 Version 7.1 server,
the Administration Client, the Application Development Client,
the documentation, and the creation of a sample database,
you will need about 350 MB of free disk space.

<term>glibc</term>
<listitem>
<para><literal>2.1.2</literal> or greater. This can be a tough part of Linux to upgrade on
its own, so if your current distribution doesn't meet this requirement,
I would strongly suggest upgrading your entire distribution. For example,
I tried upgrading only the <literal>glibc</literal> portion of
TurboLinux 4.0 from <literal>2.1.1</literal> to <literal>2.1.3</literal>
and ran into a whole world of trouble.
</para>

<para>
DB2 Version 7.1 should work with <literal>glibc</literal> 2.1.1.

<para><literal>2.2.12</literal> or greater. I've upgraded to both
<literal>2.2.19</literal> and <literal>2.4.3</literal> and recompiled
 the kernel for my own purposes, and DB2 seems to work as well as before.
</para>

<para>
DB2 Version 7.1 should work with a minimum of kernel 2.2.10.
IBM sets prerequisites based on the systems with which they tested.

</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>libncurses</term>

<varlistentry>
<term>libstdc++-libc6.1-1.so.2</term>
<listitem>
<para>A file or symbolic link by this exact name is mandatory.
On most distributions, this is a symbolic link to <literal>libstdc++-2.9.0.so</literal>,
but on several recent distributions this is a symbolic link to
<literal>libstdc++-2.10.0.so</literal>.
<note>
<para>
In previous versions of this HOWTO, I stated that the exact version
of <literal>libstdc++-2.9.0.so</literal> was mandatory. I was wrong.

</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>pdksh</term>
<listitem>
<para><literal>5.2</literal> or greater. This is a public domain version of the

require. You cannot do anything with DB2 without installing pdksh.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>rpm</term>
<listitem>
<para><literal>3.0</literal> or greater. DB2 for Linux is distributed

As of this writing, the minimum required level of the
IBM Developer Kit for Java 1.1.8 is the March 22, 2000 release.

<emphasis>Please note</emphasis>: Other versions of Java, such

</question>
<answer>
<para>
It means something went slightly wrong, but it's okay.
You may get this message splashed across your installation
screen one or more times during the DB2 installation process, but
other than not looking pretty, DB2 still installs correctly.
Caldera apparently doesn't include a <filename>/etc/login.defs</filename> configuration
file. The file controls the default options for the <command>useradd</command> command
for adding new users, including policies like how many days before the
new user's password expires and whether a home directory should be created for a new user.
For more information on the <filename>/etc/login.defs</filename> file, refer
to the <command>man</command> page for <command>useradd</command>.

<title>Adding instance user IDs to their groups</title>
<para>
The most important step is to manually add the instance user ID to
the corresponding instance group you defined during the instance
creation step. DB2 and Caldera OpenLinux don't get this part of the
DB2 instance creation process right, so you have to do it yourself.
You can add an instance user ID to an instance group in two ways:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Edit <filename>/etc/group</filename> to add the
appropriate instance user ID to the last field for each group.

<title>Changing the default home page in Netscape</title>
<para>
The DB2 Control Center and the DB2 Information Center use the
Netscape browser to display help and documentation. This works
for the first document you display in the browser, but if you
try to switch to a different DB2 document (for example, from
one book to another), you may instead be redirected to the
default home page set by the Caldera OpenLinux installation
process. I found that this problem went away as soon as I changed
the default home page in the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu,
<guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem> menu item.

<sect4 id="calderagreeting">
<title>Removing the Caldera login greeting</title>
<para>
Add a file called <filename>.hushlogin</filename> to the
home directory of each of your instance user IDs. This should prevent
the <computeroutput>Welcome to your OpenLinux system!</computeroutput>
messages while running DB2 commands.
</para>

<para>
DB2 generates these messages on Caldera because the DB2 commands run
under the root user ID, which in turn becomes the instance owner to
invoke commands. Part of this <command>su</command> process
calls one or both of <filename>/etc/config.d/shells/csh.login</filename>
and <filename>/etc/config.d/shells/profile</filename>, which in turn
call the <filename>/etc/config.d/shells/OL-greeting</filename> script
that contains the offensive string.
</para>

<para>
Instead of adding <filename>.hushlogin</filename> to every
user's home directory, you could probably edit
<filename>/etc/config.d/shells/OL-greeting</filename>
to remove the message (or change it to something else, if you want).
I haven't tried it myself, so let me know what works best.

<para>
These components determine the state of your DB2 installation as a database server.
The core capabilities of the components are the same. The difference between
Enterprise Edition and Workgroup Edition primarily has to do with how they are
licensed--Enterprise Edition is licensed on a per-processor basis
with unlimited users, while Workgroup Edition is licensed on a per-user basis.
Enterprise Edition also gives you the capability to enable DB2 clients to connect
to mainframe databases, like DB2 for OS/390 or DB2 for OS/400. In contrast,
Personal Edition is a single user database server that is useful only for developing
DB2 applications. You cannot use Personal Edition as a server because Personal Edition
does not accept incoming remote connections.

Christoph Shmitz reports that, while he was able to install
DB2 Version 7.1 Personal Developer's Edition on Debian 2.2
using <command>alien</command> as described above, DB2 starts in a
time-limited trial mode (90 days). While the use of
DB2 Version 7.1 Personal Developer's Edition should be unlimited,
<command>alien</command> does not automatically install the DB2 license file.
</para>
<para>
To remove the time limit on DB2 Version 7.1 Personal Developer's Edition,
you need to manually install the license file
(<filename>s000510.personal/db2/license/db2udbpe.lic</filename> in the tar archive)
using the following command as root:
<programlisting format="linespecific">
bash# db2licm -a db2udbpe.lic
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
Using <command>alien</command> apparently prevents you from using the <command>db2setup</command> command
to create instances. To create a DB2 Administration Server from the command line,
issue the <filename>/usr/ibmdb2/v7.1/instance/dasicrt</filename> command as root.
To create a DB2 instance, issue the <filename>/usr/ibmdb2/v7.1/instance/db2icrt</filename>
command as root. To get the correct syntax for either command, use the <literal>-h</literal> flag.

<title>Creating DB2 instances</title>

<para>
This section gives you a brief overview of DB2 instances
and the DB2 Administration Server, and tells you how to create them.
</para>

<para>
Some IBM documentation uses the term "instance" to refer to both
DB2 instances and a DB2 Administration Server. The basic similarity
between a DB2 Administration Server and a DB2 instance,
or "database manager", is that each is associated with a
unique user ID. When you create either a DB2 instance or a
DB2 Administration Server, DB2:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>
creates one or more new user IDs and corresponding home directories
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
creates a subdirectory in the instance home directory called
<filename class="directory">sqllib</filename>
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
alters the <filename>.bashrc</filename> file to call the
<filename class="directory">~/sqllib/</filename><filename>db2profile</filename> shell
script to set up the environment for the instance
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Overview of DB2 Administration Server</title>

<para>
Like a queen bee in a hive, only one DB2 Administration Server can
exist on any given DB2 server. By locally or remotely logging as the user ID that
corresponds to the DB2 Administration Server, a database administrator
uses the DB2 Administration Server to create, drop, or change the properties
of DB2 instances.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Overview of DB2 instance</title>

<para>
To quote the IBM DB2 Universal Database Version 7.1 Administration Guide definition of an instance:
<blockquote>
<para>
An instance (sometimes called a database manager) is DB2 code that manages data.
It controls what can be done to the data, and manages system resources assigned to it.
Each instance is a complete environment. ...  An instance has its own databases (which
other instances cannot access), and all its database partitions share the same system
directories. It also has separate security from other instances on the same machine (system).
</para>
</blockquote>

What this boils down to is that for every DB2 instance, DB2 requires a unique user ID
on your Linux workstation. Security for an instance is provided by the normal
password authentication process for any Linux user ID. Each instance can contain
one or more databases, each of which inherits settings from their instance.
</para>

<procedure>
<title>Creating the Administration Server using <command>db2setup</command></title>

<title>The DB2 command line</title>

<para>
If you are logged on to your Linux workstation using either the
DB2 Administration Server user ID or the DB2 instance user ID,
you can issue DB2 commands and SQL statements from
the command line.
</para>

<para>
If this is your first time using DB2, I would suggest creating the
sample database that ships with DB2. The sample database is used
throughout the DB2 documentation and is required by most of the
sample applications.
To create the sample database, you can either select the
<literal>Create the sample database</literal> option when you
create a DB2 instance, or issue the <command>db2sampl</command>
command from the DB2 command line.
</para>

<para>
Before you can issue an SQL statement, you have to connect to a
database. To connect to a database:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
<command>db2 CONNECT TO <replaceable>database</replaceable> USER <replaceable>userID</replaceable> USING <replaceable>password</replaceable></command>
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>
To connect to a database, and have DB2 prompt you for the password:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
<command>db2 CONNECT TO <replaceable>database</replaceable> USER <replaceable>userID</replaceable></command>
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
To connect to a database using the default user ID:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
<command>db2 CONNECT TO <replaceable>database</replaceable></command>
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
Once you have connected to a database, you can then issue SQL statements
or DB2 commands against that database.
For example, to select all of the columns from the <literal>EMPLOYEE</literal>
table in the <literal>SAMPLE</literal> database,
issue the following command: <programlisting format="linespecific">bash&dollar; db2 "SELECT * FROM employee"</programlisting>
</para>

<note>
<para>
You can avoid typing <command>db2</command> as the prefix for every
SQL statement and DB2 command by issuing commands using the
Command Line Processor (<acronym>CLP</acronym>). To start the CLP,
issue the <command>db2</command> command by itself. DB2 provides the following prompt:

<programlisting format="linespecific">

You can issue database manager commands and SQL statements from the command
prompt. For example:
    db2 =&gt; connect to sample
    db2 =&gt; bind sample.bnd

For general help, type: ?.
For command help, type: ? command, where command can be
the first few keywords of a database manager command. For example:
 ? CATALOG DATABASE for help on the CATALOG DATABASE command
 ? CATALOG          for help on all of the CATALOG commands.

To exit db2 interactive mode, type QUIT at the command prompt. Outside
interactive mode, all commands must be prefixed with 'db2'.
To list the current command option settings, type LIST COMMAND OPTIONS.

For more detailed help, refer to the Online Reference Manual.

db2 =&gt;

</programlisting>

I don't use the CLP because it prevents me from using the
command line history feature of my shell. I find myself using
the command line history a lot when I'm issuing SQL statements.
</para>
<para>
Some users claim that running the CLP within an Emacs shell gives
them the best of both worlds: they get command line history, and they
don't have to escape commands that contain lots of quotation marks
and brackets.

installing DB2 (see <xref linkend="suselinux"/>), the default user name already exists and was created in the
<filename class="directory">/usr/lib/db2/</filename> directory. To change the
home directory of your new DB2 instance, you must manually specify
the location of the new instance. The default home

<emphasis>After creating a DB2 instance, I installed the Application Development Client,
but I can't use that instance to create DB2 applications.</emphasis>
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
When you add the Application Development Client after you initially install
DB2 and create a DB2 instance, your existing DB2 instance won't recognize the
<command>db2 prep</command> command. Instead, DB2 returns the following error:
<computeroutput>DB21051E The command is not supported for this environment.</computeroutput>
</para>

<para>
The problem is that when you install a new DB2 component, DB2 does not automatically update
existing DB2 instances to include links to the new libraries and executables.
To update an existing DB2 instance, use the <command>db2iupdt</command> command as root:
<programlisting format="linespecific">bash# /usr/IBMdb2/V7.1/instance/db2iupdt <replaceable>instance-name</replaceable></programlisting>
To update all existing DB2 instances, issue the following command as root:

<emphasis>Creating a DB2 instance or a DB2 Administration Server fails.</emphasis>
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
DB2 often fails to create an instance because you became root by issuing the command
<userinput>bash&dollar; su root</userinput> rather than <userinput>bash&dollar; su -l root</userinput>, which
uses the environment settings for the root account.  Check the contents of the DB2 install log
in <filename>/tmp/db2setup.log</filename>. If the installer has issued the following error message:

<programlisting format="linespecific">
  DBI1517E An attempt to execute a command in a subprocess failed.

  Explanation: An error was detected when attempting to execute a command in a subprocess. One of the
  following problems occurred:

      o The command does not exist.
      o Incomplete command search path.
      o Incorrect access permissions on the command.
      o System resource problem.
</programlisting>

then most likely your root account did not have the
<filename class="directory">/usr/sbin</filename> directory in the PATH
environment variable for root.
</para>

<para>PATH is normally set correctly for you if you log in as
root, or issue the command <userinput>bash&dollar; su -l root</userinput> to become root. You can
add <filename class="directory">/usr/sbin</filename> to the
PATH environment variable by issuing the following command at the terminal
prompt, or including it in <filename>/root/.bashrc</filename>:

(Caldera OpenLinux 2.4).
</emphasis>
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
This is one area where DB2 and Caldera OpenLinux don't work well together.
Fix this by manually adding each instance user ID to the group
you defined during instance creation. Here's the full help from
the IBM DB2 Message Reference:

<programlisting format="linespecific">
      DBI1766W Cannot change the secondary group list of
                "".

      Explanation:  A code, "", is returned when attempting to
      change the secondary group list of the given user ID. One of the
      following situations has occurred:

      o  NIS is running.

      o  One or more processes are currently being executed under the
          given user ID.

      User Response:  You must add the group ID, "", to the
      secondary group list of the user ID, "", so that the
      Adminstration Server can function properly.

      o  If there happens to be any process run under the given user
          ID, terminate all of these processes and follow the
          instructions above to setup the secondary group list of this
          user ID.

      o  If you are running this command on an NIS client, try the
          above instructions to setup the secondary group list of this
          user ID on your NIS server.

If the Control Center displays an empty "Systems" folder,

</question>
<answer>
<para>
This normally indicates an X permissions problem that occurs when you log on as one user, then
<command>su</command> to the DB2 instance owner so that you can start the DB2 Control Center.
By default, most X servers do not recognize 'localhost' as a client that is allowed to initiate
an X app on your display; it will only recognize your real hostname. If <command>xauth</command>
is set up, then it will complain if a user ID other than the one that started X tries to invoke
an X application.There are a few things you can try:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Before su'ing to the DB2 instance owner, issue the command <userinput>bash$ xhost +localhost</userinput>:
this tells your X server that 'localhost' is allowed to start X apps on your display. Then <command>su</command>
to the DB2 instance owner and start the Control Center.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Log out completely, then log on directly as the DB2 instance owner and start the Control Center.
You may still have to issue the command <userinput>bash$ xhost +localhost</userinput> before the
Control Center will start--recent distributions have added this extra level of security.
</para>
</listitem>

<para>
Look into the <command>xauth</command> command and add your primary user ID's

<title>Improving DB2 Version 7.1 performance on Linux</title>

<para>Database administrators running DB2 on Linux often run into
problems attempting to perform the following tasks:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
increasing the maximum number of simultaneous connections to the DB2 server
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
configuring buffer pools
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
The following sections attempt to address those problems.
</para>

<sect2 id="maxconnect">
<title>Increasing maximum connections</title>
<para>
One of the most frequently reported problems with running DB2 on Linux is that
DB2 seems to quickly start refusing connections to the server. You can alleviate
this problem by examining an altering several kernel parameters that control
inter-process communication (<acronym>ipc</acronym>) limits.
</para>
<para>
The number of connections that DB2 can support depends on kernel parameters that,
in the 2.2 kernel, are <literal>#define</literal> variables included in the
kernel source header files. In the 2.4 kernel, some of these parameters can be set
through the <filename class="directory">/proc</filename> filesystem.
Following the description of these
variables is a table listing the default values by distribution. The table includes the values
of these variables in the updated kernel packages for each distribution.
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>_SHM_ID_BITS</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This variable, defined in <filename>/usr/src/linux/include/asm/shmparam.h</filename>,
determines the number of shared memory segment identifiers available to Linux. The
default value for <literal>_SHM_ID_BITS</literal> in the kernel source
is <literal>7</literal>, which allows for a total of 2^7, or 128,
shared memory segment identifiers.
</para>
<para>
On a single-processor machine, DB2 itself uses a set number (~15) of
shared memory segment identifiers. On a machine with multiple processors,
DB2 also requires one shared memory segment identifier per agent to take
advantage of the Fast Communication Manager (<acronym>FCM</acronym>) feature
of DB2. Because each DB2 connection requires one agent per processor,
on a quad-processor machine the default value of <literal>_SHM_ID_BITS</literal>
allows less than 32 simultaneous connections to a DB2 instance.
</para>
<para>
If you recompile the kernel yourself, you should be able to safely
increase this value to <literal>9</literal>.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>MSGMNI</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This variable determines the maximum number of message queue identifiers.
For DB2 Version 7.1 to function correctly, the minimum value is <literal>128</literal>,
but for heavier use consider setting this value to <literal>1024</literal> or
higher.
</para>
<para>
In the 2.2 kernel source, this variable is defined in
<filename>/usr/src/linux/include/linux/msg.h</filename>. The default value of
<literal>128</literal> is acceptable for small-scale use of DB2 Version 7.1.
</para>
<para>
In the 2.4 kernel source, this variable is defined in
<filename>/proc/sys/kernel/msgmni</filename>. The default value of
<literal>16</literal> must be increased to enable DB2 Version 7.1 to
function correctly. The good news is that you can change this value
without recompiling the kernel or rebooting your machine.
For more information, see <xref linkend="kernel24"/>.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>NR_TASKS</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This variable, defined in <filename>/usr/src/linux/include/linux/tasks.h</filename>,
determines the number of simultaneous processes that Linux
supports. A second variable, <literal>MAX_TASKS_PER_USER</literal>, is defined
as <literal>NR_TASKS/2</literal>. Since DB2 instances are treated as
users by Linux, and each connection uses a single process, the maximum number
of connections per instance is capped at the value of <literal>NR_TASKS/2</literal>.
</para>
<para>
The default value for <literal>NR_TASKS</literal> in the kernel source is <literal>512</literal>,
allowing a maximum of 256 simultaneous connections to a single DB2 instance.
DB2 itself requires a few connections for overhead processes.
If you recompile the kernel yourself, you should increase this value to something like 2048.
The stock kernels shipped with the Red Hat, SuSE, and TurboLinux distributions
increase the value of <literal>NR_TASKS</literal> to 2560 or above.
However, Caldera OpenLinux eDesktop 2.4 ships with a kernel in which <literal>NR_TASKS</literal>
is set to the default value of 512. Caldera users should increase the value
of this variable and recompile the kernel.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>SEMMNI</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This variable, defined in <filename>/usr/src/linux/include/linux/sem.h</filename>,
determines the number of semaphore identifiers that Linux supports. This variable
is particularly important on symmetric multi-processing (<acronym>SMP</acronym>)
machines. A unique semaphor identifier is required for each processor per agent
(or connection); therefore, on a quad-processor machine, four semaphore identifiers
are required per connection.
</para>
<para>
The default value for <literal>SEMMNI</literal> in the kernel source is <literal>128</literal>,
which, on a quad-processor machine, will only allow 32 simultaneous connections to a DB2 instance.
If you recompile the kernel yourself, increase this value to something like 1024.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

</variablelist>
</para>

<para>
The following table shows the default values of the kernel parameters
set in the stock kernel source and in the kernels provided by each
distribution.
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
<literal>unknown</literal> indicates that I don't

<title>Creating and configuring buffer pools</title>
<para>
A buffer pool is a database object representing system memory used
to cache table and index data as it is read from disk or modified.
DB2 allocates a default buffer pool of 4 megabytes of memory. This
is a ridiculous default for a production database because it will
inhibit performance greatly. To get good performance out of DB2,
 you must create one or more buffer pools and associate them with
the tablespaces used to hold the tables in your database. For more
information on buffer pools and increasing performance, see the
<citetitle pubwork="book"><ulink url="http://www.ibm.com/cgi-bin/db2www/data/db2/udb/winos2unix/support/v7pubs.d2w/main">IBM DB2 Administration Guide: Performance</ulink></citetitle>.
</para>
<para>
On a system with a 2.2 kernel compiled with support for &gt;1 gigabyte of
RAM, the practical upper limit for buffer pools is about 1 gigabyte of memory
due to the location in memory in which Linux loads shared libraries.

<sect1>
<title>Preamble</title>
<para>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
</para>
<para>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
</para>
<para>

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
</para>
<para>

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.
</para>
<para>

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
</para>
<para>

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.
</para>
<para>

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
</para>
<para>

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
</para>
<sect2>
<title>
    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
</title>
<para>

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
</para>
<para>

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
</para>
<para>

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
</para>
<para>

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
</para>
<para>

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
</para>
<para>

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
</para>
<para>

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.
</para>
<para>

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
</para>
<para>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
</para>
<para>

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
</para>
<para>

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
</para>
<para>

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
</para>
<para>

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
</para>
<para>

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,
</para>
<para>

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
</para>
<para>

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
</para>
<para>

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
</para>
<para>
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
</para>
<para>

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.
</para>
<para>

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.
</para>
<para>

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
</para>
<para>

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
</para>
<para>

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

<para>
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
</para>
<para>

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.
</para>
<para>

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
</para>
<para>

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

<title>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</title>

<para>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
</para>
<para>

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
</para>

<programlisting format="linespecific">

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:
</para>
<programlisting format="linespecific">
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) <emphasis>year name of author</emphasis>
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
</programlisting>
<para>

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
</para>
<para>

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
</para>
<programlisting format="linespecific">
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

<para>

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.
