<para>Big thanks to Dan Scott, who kindly handed this project over with
his blessing, and even found time to handle the DocBook conversion for this 
version. Dan is responsible for getting both of us interested in
DB2 UDB on Linux throughout the past four years. His work on the
original DB2 UDB Version 7.1 for Linux HOWTO, published by the LDP,
stands as a testament to his hard work and dedication and we hope this
document can live up to those high standards.</para>

their love and support.</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>About the authors</title>
<para>Ian Hakes, R.H.C.E., has worked for IBM in DB2 UDB Information
Development since 1999. Currently, he is the team lead for the DB2 UDB
Information Development Infrastructure team, developing solutions to
improve writers lives as they put together the official documentation.
Before that, he was the writer responsible for the DB2 UDB SQL Reference
manual. His free time is spent mainly on computers, thinking about how
much nicer it would be to be outside sailing or hiking.</para>
<para>Rory A.A. Hinton, Ph.D., is presently employed at ATI
Technologies. He works in Application Engineering, writing BIOS
development and register programming  reference guides. In his spare
time, he cuts his lawn, drinks Ricard with ice and water,  and hosts a

<para>Take into account the disk space requirements before you install
and configure DB2 UDB on your distribution:

<para>It's important to allocate enough disk space for the required
software prerequisites, along with the product documentation (if
desired) and the databases you create. For example, in Version 8.2, DB2
UDB product documentation is accessed through the DB2 UDB Information
Center. This is a separately installable product that requires at least
100 MB when installing the core English language files. Additional space
is required for additional languages. However, if disk space is an
issue, you can configure DB2 UDB to access the Information Center from
the Web. More detail about this great feature is provided in <xref linkend="help" endterm="help.title" />.</para></sect3>
<sect3><title>Memory requirements</title>
<para>You should allocate a minimum of 256 MB of RAM for a product like
the DB2 UDB Enterprise Server Edition, but additional memory should be
allocated for other software and communication processes. When
determining memory requirements, consider the following points:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Your SWAP space should be at least twice as much as your
RAM.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Additional memory should be allocated for any non-DB2
UDB software that may be running on your system.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Additional memory is required to support database
clients and database activity.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>These memory requirements will be affected by the size
and complexity of your database system, as well as specific performance
requirements.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist></para></sect3></sect2>
<sect2><title>Software requirements</title>
<sect3><title>Distribution levels that are supported by DB2 UDB Version 8.2</title>
<para>In DB2 UDB Version 6, only 32-bit Intel architectures were
supported. With the release of DB2 UDB Version 8.2, IBM has demonstrated
its support for the Linux platform by validating on a much broader range
of architectures. For the sake of convenience, this table lists the
recommended and validated distributions that DB2 UDB officially supports
in Version 8.2.

well as the latest information about kernels, libraries, integrated
cluster environments, and papers, visit the

<sect3><title>Required kernel levels and libraries</title>
<sect4><title>Kernel parameter values</title>
<para>To successfully run DB2 UDB on your Linux distribution, you may be
required to update some of the default kernel parameter settings. For
example, the 2.4.x series kernel message queue parameter msgmni has a
default value that allows only a limited number of simultaneous
connections to DB2 UDB.</para>
<para>These are the recommended values for DB2 UDB to run optimally:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>kernel.shmmax=268435456 for 32-bit</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>kernel.shmmax=1073741824 for 64-bit</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>kernel.msgmni=1024</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>fs.file-max=8192</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>kernel.sem="250 32000 32 1024"</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist></para>
<para>Fortunately, DB2 UDB Version 8.2 has a new feature that checks the
values of the kernel.semmni, kernel.msgmni, and kernel.shmmax parameters
when you enter the db2start command, and changes them for you if the
current values are not optimal. This new feature makes these changes:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>The semmni kernel parameter is changed to
1024</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The msgmni kernel parameter is changed to
1024</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The shmmax kernel parameter is changed to 268435456
(32-bit) or 1073741824 (64-bit)</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist></para>
<para>For example, after you issue the db2start command for the
first time, you should receive output like the following messages in
your db2diag.log file:
<screen>
ADM0506I DB2 has automatically updated the "semmni" kernel
parameter from "128" to the recommended value "1024".

2004-07-31-16.38.59.074791 Instance:db2inst1
Node:000
PID:15996(db2sysc) TID:8192 Appid:none
base sys utilities sqlesysc_main Probe:9

ADM0506I DB2 has automatically updated the "msgmni" kernel
parameter from "16" to the recommended value "1024".

2004-07-31-16.38.59.076916 Instance:db2inst1
Node:000
PID:15996(db2sysc) TID:8192 Appid:none
base sys utilities sqlesysc_main Probe:9

ADM0506I DB2 has automatically updated the "shmmax" kernel
parameter from "33554432" to the recommended value "268435456".

2004-07-31-16.39.01.262594 Instance:db2inst1
Node:000
PID:15994(db2star2) TID:8192 Appid:none
base sys utilities startdbm Probe:911

ADM7513W Database manager has started.</screen></para>
<para>Notice that db2start did not update the fs.file-max parameter. Any
kernel at 2.4.18 and later automatically updates this parameter.
Because of this new feature, it is no longer necessary for you to
manually update the kernel.shmmax, kernel.msgmni, and kernel.sem
parameters prior to installing DB2
UDB.</para></sect4>
<sect4><title>Manually updating kernel parameters</title>
<para>If, for some reason, you need to change these default settings, you can
update them manually. To check your current shared memory segment,
semaphore array, and message queue limits, enter the ipcs -l command.
Your output should look something like this:
<screen>        ------ Shared Memory Limits --------
        max number of segments = 4096
        max seg size (kbytes) = 32768
        max total shared memory (kbytes) = 8388608
        min seg size (bytes) = 1
        ------ Semaphore Limits --------
        max number of arrays = 1024
        max semaphores per array = 250
        max semaphores system wide = 32000
        max ops per semop call = 32
        semaphore max value = 32767
        ------ Messages: Limits --------
        max queues system wide = 1024
        max size of message (bytes) = 8192
	default max size of queue (bytes) = 16384
</screen></para>
<para>For example, here are instructions on how to modify the
kernel.shmmax, kernel.sem, and the kernel.msgmni parameters on Red Hat
Linux 8, and how to keep them set after a reboot.
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Log on as a user with root authority</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Open up <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename> in a text editor and add
entries:
<screen>kernel.shmmax=268435456
kernel.msgmni=1024
kernel.sem="250 32000 32 1024"</screen></para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Enter the sysctl -p command to load in sysctl settings
from <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename>.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Enter the ipcs -l to view the updated kernel parameters
in sysctl.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
To view all sysctl settings,
enter: <command>sysctl -a</command>. You can also temporarily update the kernel parameters
(during run time) by using the <command>sysctl -w</command> command. For example, to
change the kernel.msgmni parameter to 1024, enter the command:
<screen>sysctl -w kernel.msgmni=1024</screen>
These settings will
not remain after the next reboot unless they are saved in the
<filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename> file.</para>
<para>Again, consider the same procedure on SuSE Linux. Modifying kernel
parameters on SuSE Linux is a little different from the method on Red
Hat Linux. These instructions will explain how to update the
kernel.shmmax, kernel.sem, and the kernel.msgmni parameters, and how
to set them for reboot.
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Log in as a user with root authority.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Some SuSE Linux distributions do not have a
<filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename>  file. If so, you need to create one manually using a
text editor.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>In the <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename> file, add entries:
<programlisting>        kernel.shmmax=268435456
        kernel.msgmni=1024
        fs.file-max=8129
        kernel.sem="250 32000 32 1024"</programlisting></para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Enter the <command>sysctl -p</command> command to load in sysctl settings
from <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename>.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Add sysctl -p to a system initialization file to set
kernel parameters after each reboot. To do this, write a script and
configure it to run automatically at runlevel 5. Specifically, you
need to create an executable file in <filename class='directory'>/etc/init.d/</filename>, and then add pointers
to this script in <filename class='directory'>/etc/init.d/rc5.d</filename>. For example, in <filename class='directory'>/etc/init.d</filename> create
an executable file named <command>kerneldb2</command> that contains the script:
<screen>#! /bin/sh
#
#
# /etc/init.d/kerneldb2
#
### END INIT INFO
touch /var/lock/subsys/kerneldb2
/sbin/sysctl -p >> /var/lock/subsys/kerneldb2
</screen></para>
<para>Then in <filename class='directory'>/etc/init.d/rc5.d</filename>, we added pointers to the kerneldb2 script by entering
the commands:
<screen>cd /etc/init.d/rc5.d
ln -s ../kerneldb2 S99kerneldb2
ln -s ../kerneldb2 K99kerneldb2</screen>
Like Red Hat Linux, you
can temporarily update the kernel parameters (during run time) by using
the <command>sysctl -w</command> command. For example, to change the kernel.sem
parameter, enter the command:
<screen>sysctl -w kernel.sem="250 32000 32 1024"</screen>
Again, these settings will not
remain after the next reboot unless they are saved in the
<filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename>
file.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist></para></sect4></sect3>
<sect3><title>The IBM Developer Kit for Java (SDK), Version 1.3.1 and 1.4.1</title>
<para>If the IBM SDK for Java is required by a component being
installed, and it's not already installed on your computer, the SDK for
Java will be installed if you use either the DB2 UDB Setup wizard or a
response file to install the product. If you use the db2_install utility
to install DB2 UDB, the SDK won't get installed. In that case, you must
install the rpm file manually.</para>
<para>You require the appropriate level of IBM Software Development Kit

Development Center, and to create and run Java applications, including
stored procedures and user-defined functions.</para>

<para>When you install DB2 UDB on Linux, the RPM-based installation
attempts to install IBM's version of Java (IBM SDK 1.4.1 SR2). If a
later installed level of the RPM, such as IBM SDK 1.5.1 SR1, is
detected, the back-level RPM is not installed.</para>
<para>However, in this case, the installation leaves the JDK_PATH
database configuration parameter pointing to the back-level path. As a
result, none of the Java-dependent functionality, including the
installation of the DB2 UDB Tools Catalog, will work.</para>
<para>To solve this problem, run the following commands as the instance owner (for
example, db2inst1): 
<screen>db2 UPDATE DBM CFG USING JDK_PATH <varname>existing SDK path</varname>
db2 UPDATE ADMIN CFG USING JDK_PATH <varname>existing SDK path</varname></screen>

To check whether you have these packages installed, use the 
<command>rpm -q</command> commands:
<screen>rpm -qa | grep pdksh
rpm -qa | grep rsh
rpm -qa | grep nfs</screen>
For each command, if you have these packages installed, your
system should return the following output:
<screen>pdksh-5.2.14-19
rsh-0.17-10
rsh-server-0.17-10
redhat-config-nfs-1.0.1-3
nfs-utils-1.0.1-2</screen>
To install these
packages on Red Hat Linux, use the Red Hat Linux installation CDs, or
the <command>up2date</command> utility, and the <command>rpm</command> command. For example, to install pdksh
on from the Red Hat Linux CD, mount the Red Hat Linux CD #3, and
enter this command as root:
<screen>rpm -ivh /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/pdksh-5.2.14-19.i386.rpm</screen>
To install using the up2date package, run this command as root:
<screen>up2date pdksh</screen>
To install these packages on SuSE Linux, you can also use <command>rpm</command>
or use the handy YaST (Yet another Setup Tool) utility. For example, to
install pdksh on SuSE Linux Pro 8 using YaST:

<sect2><title>Installation methods</title>
<para>You can use four methods to install DB2 UDB:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para><command>db2setup</command> utility</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para><command>db2_install</command> utility</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>A DB2 response file</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>Linux <command>rpm</command> command</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
Each
method has its own advantages and disadvantages. The preferred
method often depends on your level of expertise and type of environment,
but in general, if a graphical terminal is available, using db2setup is
recommended.</para>
<sect3><title>db2setup installation</title>
  <para>The <command>db2setup</command> command starts the DB2 UDB Setup wizard, a
Java-based graphical tool that installs DB2 UDB. It lays down the DB2
UDB filesets, the IBM SDK for Java, and allows you to create DB2 UDB
instances, create new users and groups, configure existing users,
configure communications, create the tools catalog database, and set up
notification. The DB2 UDB Setup wizard also allows you to create a
response file.</para>
<para>Using <command>db2setup</command> is the best method for less experienced
users, because most of the configuration is automatically performed
during the installation. Again, you require X Window System software
capable of rendering a graphical user interface, to use db2setup
successfully.</para></sect3>
<sect3><title>db2_install installation</title>
  <para>The <command>db2_install</command> command starts the <command>db2_install</command> script. This script
installs all DB2 UDB packages on your Linux system using the RPM
installation utility. This method is reliable and commonly used by
expert users for installing DB2 UDB on larger, more complex
multiple-partition systems. However, tasks such as setting up users and
groups, creating instances, tools catalog database creation, and
notification setup need to be performed manually after the
installation is completed.</para>
<para>A limitation to <command>db2_install</command> is that it only installs user
assistance (like help, messages, and tool interfaces) in English,
whereas <command>db2setup</command> installs support for one or more different languages.
Also, a <command>db2_install</command> installation can take longer (considering the higher
number of manual configuration tasks), it requires a higher level of
knowledge and skill, and it cannot create response
files.</para></sect3>
<sect3><title>Response file installation</title>
<para>A response file can be created using the DB2 UDB Setup wizard or
by editing a sample response file. It allows you to install DB2 UDB
across multiple machines with consistent installation and configuration
settings. A response file installation is fast, because it bypasses the
graphical wizard and does the configuration for you. Another advantage
of using a response file is that it creates a Database Administration
Server (DAS) on each machine, while with <command>db2_install</command>
the DAS must be created manually after installation.</para>
<para>The sample response file can be used to install DB2 UDB, configure
users, create instances, set up notification, create the tools catalog,
and configure a large number of DBM parameters. This is the quickest
installation method if you already have all the information you need.
Unlike <command>db2setup</command>, the response file installation is
not interactive, and it takes longer to prepare the response
file.</para></sect3>
<sect3><title>RPM command installation</title>
<para>The Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) is a Linux software installation
command. The various DB2 UDB installation methods use RPM to lay down
the appropriate files on the system. Using the RPM command to install
DB2 UDB allows you to select specific DB2 UDB files. However, the RPM
installation method will only install the DB2 UDB code. It will not
create instances, user IDs, or response files during DB2 installation.
Please note that this installation method is not officially supported or
recommended.</para></sect3></sect2>
<sect2><title>Storage planning</title>
<para>In this section these storage considerations are discussed:
  <itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>Log storage</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>Temporary table space storage</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist></para>
<sect3><title>Log storage</title>
<para>By default, DB2 UDB sets the log path to the default database path
during database creation.</para>
<para>You should store both the primary copy of the logs and the mirror
logs each on a physically separate disk, preferably one that is also on
a different disk controller.</para>
<para>Mirror logs are created using the MIRRORLOGPATH
configuration parameter. Log mirroring allows the database to write an
identical second copy of log files to a different path. For example, you
can change the primary log path from the default to <filename class='directory'>/db2log1</filename>, and
set the mirror log path to <filename class='directory'>/db2log2</filename>
by issuing these commands:
<screen>db2 update db cfg for db_name using NEWLOGPATH /db2log1
db2 update db cfg for db_name using MIRRORLOGPATH /db2log2</screen>
<note><para>These changes will only take place after you deactivate and
    activate your database, using the <command>db2stop</command> and 
    <command>db2start</command> commands.</para></note></para></sect3>
<sect3><title>Temporary table space storage</title>
<para>DB2 UDB uses system temporary table spaces for many SQL
operations, such as JOIN and SORT. The temporary table space,
TEMPSPACE1, is one of the three default table spaces (SYSCATSPACE,
TEMPSPACE1, and USERSPACE1) that gets created during database creation.
By default, TEMPSPACE1 gets placed in the database path. For larger
systems, we recommend that your temporary tables paces are located on a
separate file system and disk.</para>
<para>In a multiple-partition database environment, the catalog node
should contain all three default table spaces, and the other database
partitions should each contain only TEMPSPACE1 and USERSPACE1.</para>
<para>The following example shows how to create a system temporary table
  space on multiple nodes in the <filename class='directory'>/db2temp</filename>
  file system:
<programlisting>connect to db_name;
create temporary tablespace TEMPSPACE01 in IBMTEMPGROUP
managed by SYSTEM
using ('/db2temp/$INSTANCE/db_name/n001tmp/tempspace01') on \
    dbpartitionnum (1)
using ('/db2temp/$INSTANCE/db_name/n002tmp/tempspace01') on \
    dbpartitionnum (2)
using ('/db2temp/$INSTANCE/db_name/n003tmp/tempspace01') on \

<sect2><title>User and group setup</title>
<para>DB2 UDB requires user IDs and groups. This section discusses these
IDs and groups and how to create them.</para>
<sect3><title>User and group requirements</title>
<para>DB2 UDB requires a minimum of three users and groups: the instance
owning user, the fenced user, and the Database Administration Server
(DAS) user. You may use the default names provided by the setup
utilities, or specify your own user and group names. For example,
consider the following default user IDs and group names produced by the
DB2 UDB Setup wizard:

<screen>JVMDG080: Cannot find class com/ibm/jvm/Trace
JVMXM012: Error occurred in diagnostics initialization(2)
Could not create the Java virtual machine.
</screen>
The workaround for this error is to
install Sun's Java 2 Platform Standard Edition 5.0 RC (Fedora Core
2 doesn't install a Java package by default). The rpm file is available
from http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp. After installing Java,
set the environment variables in the terminal where you execute the
db2setup utility:
<screen>export DB2USELOCALJRE=TRUE
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jre1.5.0/
</screen>/usr/java/jre1.5.0/ is the location
where Java is installed by default in the rpm from Sun.</para>
<para>The last step to making this work &ndash; and this is very
important &ndash; is to add in a link named "jre" in Sun's Java folder
so that db2setup works properly with the directory:
<screen>cd /usr/java/jre1.5.0/
mkdir jre
cd jre
ln -s ../bin bin</screen></para>
<para>After making these changes, the db2setup GUI installer works
properly.</para>
<para>Alternatively, you can avoid the Java-based problems by installing
on Fedora Core 2 using 
<screen>./db2setup -r db2ese.rsp</screen>
where db2ese.rsp is a
slightly modified response file (the sample response files are found
in the "db2/linux/samples/

<para>For the GUI tools (DB2 UDB Control Center, DB2 UDB Configuration

Gentoo uses the latest version of the GNU coreutils package of utilities, which 
includes the <command>tail</command> command. The DB2 install script 
(<command>db2_install</command>) and several instance administration 
shell scripts rely on deprecated command line arguments to <command>tail</command> 
that have been removed entirely from the latest GNU <computeroutput>coreutils</computeroutput> version 
of <command>tail</command>. Therefore, you must copy the contents of the install CD 
and modify the <command>db2_install</command> script before you can successfully run the install.
</para><para>
The RPM packages supplied with the DB2 install CD contain dependency listings that cannot 
be satisfied inside a Gentoo environment, because Gentoo does not use RPM as a native

<sect2><title>Installing the Information Center
locally</title>
<para>In this example, we'll install the Information Center on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3, just because the DB2 UDB installation was so
smooth.</para>
<para>To begin, mount the CD in the drive, or expand the tarball
containing the installation utilities. Since the DB2 UDB Information
Center has it's own Java based installer, any Java issues that you
experienced above while installing DB2 UDB will likely recur here.
However, the fixes we've provided for the DB2 UDB install should work
for the DB2 UDB Information Center install too.</para>
<para>After mounting, run the "db2setup" utility from the base
directory. This will launch the Java-based setup wizard. You can also
use the other setup methods we've talked about, but since the GUI
installation sets up and configures everything for you, that's the
method we recommend.</para>

<sect3><title>Troubleshooting</title>
<para>After installation, there are a couple of minor gotchas that you
might run into.</para>
<para>First of all, there is a bug in the CD installation that won't
unlock the CD mount. When you try to unmount the CD, you'll get the
dreaded "device is busy" message from the OS. The solution here is to
restart the Information Center daemon with the commands:
<screen>cd /tmp
/etc/init.d/db2icd restart</screen>
After the restart is complete, you can unmount the CD cleanly. This
information is covered in an ibm.com technote (<ulink url='http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21179518'>http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21179518</ulink>)</para>
<para>Another configuration change that you can make is to change what
directory the Information Center uses as a temporary working directory.
To do this, modify the DB2_ECLIPSEIC_DATA parameter in the db2ic.conf
file found in the <filename class='directory'>/var/db2/v81/</filename>
directory. This temporary directory can
be anywhere where the "bin" user can write to.</para>
<para>Also in this file, you can change the port used to serve up the
Information Center, in case you change your mind later on about the one
you set up during the install. Just change the DB2_ECLIPSEIC_PORT
parameter to the new number (though it must be under 65535).</para>
<para>After making any changes, do a 
<screen>/etc/init.d/db2icd restart</screen>
to have your changes picked up
by the Information Center (see below for more details on the db2icd
daemon).</para></sect3></sect2>
<sect2><title>The Information Center daemon</title>
<para>The Information Center daemon is set up during installation and is
used to launch the background process that runs the Information Center.
The daemon script, named db2icd is installed to the <filename class='directory'>/etc/init.d/</filename>
directory, and start up symbolic links are added to the
<filename class='directory'>/etc/init.d/rc.X/</filename> run-level folders. By default, the daemon is turned on
for run-levels 2, 3 and 5. You can modify these run-levels with any
system init utility (chkconfig, ntsysv, or any of the X-based
variants).</para>
<para>There are 5 commands you can pass to the daemon:
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>start &mdash; Starts the Information Center, using the
configuration parameters set in the /var/db2/v81/db2ic.conf
file.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>stop &mdash; Brings down the Information
Center.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>restartor reload&mdash; A combination command
that stops, then starts the daemon again.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>reload &mdash; Same as restart.</para></listitem>

Information Center is running, and if it is running, what the process
IDs (PID)
are.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist></para></sect2>
<sect2><title>Accessing an installed Information Center</title>
<para>There are three places where you can access the DB2 UDB
Information Center from your client:
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Access the publib.boulder.ibm.com Web site (this is the
default set during a client installation)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Access an intranet machine that is hosting the DB2 UDB
Information Center within your own organization</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Access an Information Center that is set up on your
local machine</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
You can configure the
access points during the installation (only by specifying a "Custom"
installation) or afterwards either in the tools configuration panel (in
the GUI tools), or from the command line.</para>
<para>For the GUI tools (Control Center), open the Tools menu, select
Tools Settings, and then the Documentation tab. On this panel, you can
specify a host URL and port where an Information Center can be found.
When putting a hostname in, do not add the "http://" prefix, or any
subdirectories &ndash; just type in the hostname, and the internal code
will do the rest.</para>
<para>To change the access points from the command line, execute these
commands:
<screen>db2set DB2_DOCHOST=<varname>host_URL</varname>
db2set DB2_DOCPORT=<varname>host_port</varname></screen>
where
host_URL is the location hostname of the Information Center. This could
be: mydocserver.myorg.net or localhost (for a local installation), and
host_port is the port number where the Information Center was
installed.</para>
<para>By default, these DB2 UDB environment settings are blank, which
means that DB2 UDB defaults to the
http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2help/ Web site.</para>
<para>To invoke the DB2 UDB Information Center from the GUI tools, click
on the "?" icon in the toolbar, any of the "Help" hyperlinks or buttons,
or by selecting any of the menu items in the "Help" menu.</para>
<para>To invoke the DB2 UDB Information Center from the command line,

<sect2><title>DB2 UDB CLP</title>
<para>If you are logged on to your Linux workstation using either the
DB2 UDB Administration Server user ID or the DB2 UDB instance user ID,
you can issue DB2 UDB commands and SQL statements from the command
line.</para>
<para>If this is your first time using DB2 UDB, I would suggest creating
the sample database that ships with DB2 UDB. The sample database is used
throughout the DB2 UDB documentation and is required by most of the
sample applications.</para>
<para>To create the sample database, you can either select the Create
the sample database option from the DB2 UDB First Steps launchpad, or
by issuing the db2sampl command.</para>
<para>Before you can issue an SQL statement, you have to connect to a
database. To connect to a database, enter the command:
<screen>db2 CONNECT TO <varname>database</varname> USER <varname>userID</varname> USING <varname>password</varname></screen></para>
<para>To connect to a database, and have DB2 UDB prompt you for the
password, issue the command:
<screen>db2 CONNECT TO <varname>database</varname> USER <varname>userID</varname></screen></para>
<para>To connect to a database using the default user ID, issue the
command:
<screen>db2 CONNECT TO <varname>database</varname></screen></para>
<para>Once you have connected to a database, you can then issue SQL
statements or DB2 UDB commands against that database. For example, to
select all of the columns from the EMPLOYEE table in the SAMPLE
database, issue this command:
<screen>db2 "SELECT * FROM employee"</screen></para>
<para>You can avoid typing db2 as the prefix for every SQL statement and
DB2 UDB command by issuing DB2 UDB commands using the Command Line
Processor (CLP). To start the CLP, issue the db2 command by itself. DB2
UDB provides the following prompt:
<screen>You can issue database manager commands and SQL statements from the
command prompt. For example:
    db2 => connect to sample
    db2 => bind sample.bnd

For general help, type: ?. 
For command help, type: ? command, where command can be 
the first few keywords of a database manager command. For example: 
 ? CATALOG DATABASE for help on the CATALOG DATABASE command
 ? CATALOG          for help on all of the CATALOG commands. 

To exit db2 interactive mode, type QUIT at the command prompt. Outside 
interactive mode, all commands must be prefixed with 'db2'. 
To list the current command option settings, type LIST COMMAND OPTIONS. 

For more detailed help, refer to the Online Reference Manual. 

db2 => </screen></para>
<para>Some users prefer to avoid the CLP because it prevents using the
command line history features of the shell.</para>
<para>Some users claim that running the CLP within an Emacs shell gives
them the best of both worlds: they get command line history, and they
don't have to escape commands that contain lots of quotation marks and
brackets.</para></sect2></sect1>

<para>59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA</para>
<para>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of
this license document, but changing it is not
allowed.</para>
<sect2><title>PREAMBLE</title>
<para>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with
or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.</para>
<para>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
designed for free software.</para>
<para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or
reference.</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</title>
<para>    This License applies to any manual or other work, in any
medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use
that work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.</para>
<para>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.</para>
<para>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part
a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
regarding them.</para>
<para>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
notice that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.</para>
<para>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that
says that the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover
Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25
words.</para>
<para>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable
copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or
discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An
image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of
text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>
<para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.</para>
<para>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in formats
which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text
near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
beginning of the body of the text.</para>
<para>A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
"Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To
"Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the Document
means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to
this definition.</para>
<para>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
which states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
meaning of this License.</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>VERBATIM COPYING</title>
<para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section
3.</para>
<para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
and you may publicly display copies.</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>
<para>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present the full title
with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited
to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
respects.</para>
<para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.</para>
<para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each
Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
network-using public has access to download using public-standard
network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of
added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity,
to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the
stated location until at least one year after the last time you
distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers)
of that edition to the public.</para>
<para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>MODIFICATIONS</title>
<para>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the
Modified Version:
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a
title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
versions    (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History
section of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous
version    if the original publisher of that version gives
permission.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons
or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors
of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than
five), unless they release you from this requirement.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Preserve all the copyright notices of the
Document.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your
modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a
license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum
below.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of
Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
license notice.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Include an unaltered copy of this
License.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its
Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title

one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the
Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous
versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least
four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of
the version it refers to gives permission.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or
"Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
equivalent are not considered part of the section
titles.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a
section may not be included in the Modified Version.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
"Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
Section.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist></para>
<para>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</para>
<para>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it
contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.</para>
<para>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the
list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already includes
a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by
arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may
not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission
from the previous publisher that added the old one.</para>
<para>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
assert or imply endorsement of any Modified
Version.</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>COMBINING DOCUMENTS</title>
<para>You may combine the Document with other documents released under
this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.</para>
<para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding
at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or
publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the
same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections
in the license notice of the combined work.</para>
<para>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
"History" in the various original documents, forming one section
Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
"Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must
delete all sections Entitled
"Endorsements".</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</title>
<para>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies
of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is
included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this
License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other
respects.</para>
<para>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</title>
<para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal
rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works
permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does
not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.</para>
<para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers
that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic
equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise
they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>TRANSLATION</title>
<para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
