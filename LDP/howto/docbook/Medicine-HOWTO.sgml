                Minor changes, Changed license to GPL. Some more reorganization. Which to say I have deleted out a ton of comments that I put that were useless. More pimping of Debian-med.

                        Major changes. Conversion from linuxdoc to DocBook format. Have basically edited out nutrition sections and most of the German section for now until I can get help again the German section. Have switched focus of the article to Medical informatics and applications, less to research applications
which should probably be a different article. Will most likely put these things
I will not maintain at the end, so someone else has some where to begin.
                        Whew. Tired from DocBook Conversion.

		<title>Debian Med</title>
		
		<para>The linux distribution by Debian is a well known and highly respected one.  The developers are all volunteers and dedicated.  Recently, it was announced that Debian would start making a Debian Med Package.  This is very very good news, because one of the things Debian is known for is its "APT-GET" interface.  This allows applications to be installed with the simple command of "apt-get install [application]". For example, if I wanted to install the OIO record system, I would simply type in 'apt-get install oio' and the apt-get program would not only install the OIO software, but would also install any software that OIO is Dependant on to run, such as the postgres database and zope software and would configure it so that you could immediately start using it.</para>
		<para>If you think I sound enthusiastic about this project, I am, because it simply would be perfect for the rest of the projects that are being developed in that would ease installment.</para>

		<title>SQL Clinic</title>

		<para>
		<ulink url="http://www.sqlclinic.net"> SQLclinic</ulink> is an impressive application that was developed for mental health workers, sponsored by their local hospital. What is most impressive is the amount of documentation. However it is unclear how useful the application would be for other non mental-health professionals.
		</para>
	
		<para>
			<blockquote>
				<attribution>Thomas Good writes</attribution>
					<para>
					To address the point about its utility outside the mental health sector: we are doing a spinoff called (believe it or not) SQL Cafe.  Why?  The local Indian restaurant (www.tasteofindia.org - I do their web pages) has hired us to design a custom database that tracks vendors, customers, uses a cgi based online menu (to replace the html version, so modifications don't require html skills) and so on.
					</para>
					
					<para>
					Seriously,  one other thing about SQL Clinic is that it was designed to be reverse engineered and used for other purposes.  It's all based on Lincoln Stein's CGI.pm module (a terrific tool) and the incredible horsepower of Postgres.  So I suspect, once Ingo and I get it a bit more streamlined, that SQL Clinic may have greater utility as an example of how to access postgres via perl than as a mere clinical application.  At least that is our goal.

					<para> Medical informatics has to do with all aspects of understanding and promoting the effective organization, analysis, management, and use of information in health care. While the field of medical informatics shares the general scope of these interests with some other health care specialties and disciplines, medical informatics has developed its own areas of emphasis and approaches that have set it apart from other disciplines and specialties. For one, a common thread through medical informatics has been the emphasis on technology as an integral tool to help organize, analyze, manage, and use information. In addition, as professionals involved at the intersection of information and technology and health care, those in medical informatics have historically tended to be engaged in the research, development, and evaluation side of things, and in studying and teaching the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of data applications in health care. However, today medical informatics also counts among its profession many whose activities are focussed on dimensions that include the administration and everyday collection and use of information in health care.

		<title>Good Electronic Health Record - GEHR</title>
			<para> The <ulink url="http://www.gehr.org/"> Good Electronic Health Record (GEHR)</ulink> , a major part of the work of the openEHR Foundation, is an evolving electronic health record architecture designed to be comprehensive, portable and medico-legally robust. It has been developed from the <ulink url="http://www.chime.ucl.ac.uk/HealthI/GEHR/"> Good European Health Record project</ulink> requirements statement and object model- the most comprehensive requirements documents ever developed for the electronic health record. This website is a public resource for documents and resources that have been used to build implementations of this record.

			<para> <ulink url="http://hl7lib.sourceforge.net"> HL7lib Health Level 7 Library</ulink> is a project that will provide a free, correct implementation of Health Level 7 functions. Health Level 7 is commonly used in large hospitals to send patient information among computer systems from different vendors. Since there is no reference implementation of HL7 many of these vendor systems vary widely in their interpretation of HL7.

		<para>An increasing role in data collection for instance in hospitals, will be played by hand-held computers (HPCs) or Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). More commonly known as PALMs. Linux offers way to exchange these data to servers, for instance via the IrDA port. See <ulink url="http://mobilix.org/howtos.html"> Infrared-HOWTO</ulink> for details.

		<title>Point of this section

		This section is acutally going to be the <emphasis>HOW-TO</emphasis> of this HOW-TO document. I intend to include instructions or refer
		to insttruction on installing what available systems that
		are readily usable at this point.

	<title>OIO
	</title>
		<sect3>
			<title>What is it?</title>
			<para>
			The OIO system starts a higher level of abstraction
			- starting with modeling "forms". The forms are then
			used to model/build progress notes etc. The OIO system
			makes use of a relational database backend (PostgreSQL) - 1) making the data/metadata/presentation separation more distinct, 2) making integration with other system (e.g. legacy systems, GnuMed, SQL Clinic etc) easier, 3) making query construction/extension easier (via SQL).
			</para>
			
			<para>If you search the OpenHealth mailing list archives, you will see extensive discussion regarding this in the context of GEHR and OIO. GEHR uses the same approach but calls this intermediate level of abstraction "archetypes".  The advantage of the OIO/GEHR approach is that the metadata components can be plug-and-play - meaning that the system can be easily extended/customized AND portable medical records become easier to implement.

<sect1 id="thought">
	<title>My thoughts</title>
	<para>Having spend some time on looking at the available software, I can only say that currently, we simply have an abundance of development, but little progress.  I keep seeing multiple projects trying to achieve the same thing, but the resources are spread too think and so they fail.  I wonder if there were some way to concentrate the various developers onto one project.
	</para>
	
	<para>The other thing I want to point out is that this is not an un-biased LDP, I may stress something more than others because I think the foundation is better or that I have seen it actually work, so if you feel something is not right, please feel free to let me know.

TO LIST:
1. Incoporate debian-med stuff: The web page is at
http://auric.debian.org/~tille/debian-med/
Much better than this document

2. WRITE HOW SECTION ON FREEPM

3. WRITE HOW TO SECTION ON TXOUTCOME.ORG.  The Obvious thing is that this thing really speeds up the production and maintanance of forms. Esp it seems to be able to track what forms for home with what answers and thenyou can print it out.
