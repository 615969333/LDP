                        Major changes. Conversion from linuxdoc to DocBook format.

Have switched focus of the article to Medical informatics and applications, less to research applications
which should probably be a different article. Will most likely put these things
I will not maintain at the end, so someone else has some where to begin.

		<title>Debian Med</title>
		
		<para>The linux distribution by Debian is a well known and highly respected one.  The developers are all volunteers and dedicated.  Recently, it was announced that Debian would start making a Debian Med Package.  This is very very good news, because one of the things Debian is known for is its "APT-GET" interface.  This allows applications to be installed with the simple command of "apt-get install [application]". For example, if I wanted to install the OIO record system, I would simply type in 'apt-get install oio' and the apt-get program would not only install the OIO software, but would also install any software that OIO is Dependant on to run, such as the postgres database and Zope software and would configure it so that you could immediately start using it.</para>
		<para>If you think I sound enthusiastic about this project, I am, because it simply would be perfect for the rest of the projects that are being developed in that would ease installment.</para>

		<title>OpenEMR</title>
		
		<para>OpenEMR is a modular, HIPAA compliant, Open Source, cross-platform 
Electronic Medical Records system (EMRS) developed by Synitech Incorporated 
(www.synitech.com). It facilitates efficient office management through 
automated patient record journaling, and has been successfully 
integrated with third-party technologies including speech recognition, secure 
wireless access, touch screen portables, and biometric authentication. 
Interface screens are themable and optimized for consistency, 
simplicity, speed of access to patient information, and minimum eye strain. 
OpenEMR is based upon widely-used public standards to achieve maximum 
compatibility with evolving technologies</para>

<para>OpenEMR has been in development and beta testing for the past 2 years, 
and is finally released to the public for download. The system is cross 
platform, and operates on top of Apache or IIS, PHP and MySQL. OpenEMR 
is fully HIPAA compliant and includes advanced authorization and 
auditing functionality, HIPAA-mandated automatic timeouts, group-based user 
configuration, extensive logging, and supports patient-requested file 
changes. There is a growing developer base dedicated to making extensible 
and configurable encounter forms and patient/office statistical 
reports, and Synitech will soon release its template Notice of Information 
Practices intended for use with OpenEMR</para>

		<title>SQL Clinic</title>

		<para>
		<ulink url="http://www.sqlclinic.net"> SQL clinic</ulink> is an impressive application that was developed for mental health workers, sponsored by their local hospital. What is most impressive is the amount of documentation. However it is unclear how useful the application would be for other non mental-health professionals.
		</para>
	
		<para>
			<blockquote>
				<attribution>Thomas Good writes</attribution>
					<para>
					To address the point about its utility outside the mental health sector: we are doing a spin-off called (believe it or not) SQL Cafe.  Why?  The local Indian restaurant (www.tasteofindia.org - I do their web pages) has hired us to design a custom database that tracks vendors, customers, uses a cgi based on-line menu (to replace the html version, so modifications don't require html skills) and so on.
					</para>
					
					<para>
					Seriously,  one other thing about SQL Clinic is that it was designed to be reverse engineered and used for other purposes.  It's all based on Lincoln Stein's CGI.pm module (a terrific tool) and the incredible horsepower of Postgres.  So I suspect, once Ingo and I get it a bit more streamlined, that SQL Clinic may have greater utility as an example of how to access postgres via Perl than as a mere clinical application.  At least that is our goal.

While the field of medical informatics shares the general scope of these interests with some other health care specialties and disciplines, medical informatics has developed its own areas of emphasis and approaches that have set it apart from other disciplines and specialties. For one, a common thread through medical informatics has been the emphasis on technology as an integral tool to help organize, analyze, manage, and use information. In addition, as professionals involved at the intersection of information and technology and health care, those in medical informatics have historically tended to be engaged in the research, development, and evaluation side of things, and in studying and teaching the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of data applications in health care. However, today medical informatics also counts among its profession many whose activities are focused on dimensions that include the administration and everyday collection and use of information in health care.

	<para>I will try to be pretty cook book about how to install these applications, which means that if I can, i will always tell you what to type (at least what to type that works for me).  The problem is that this assumes that you know what a shell window is and can switch directories with-in, which actually assumes a fair level of technical sophistication since most of us have gotten used to Microsoft based Windows systems. Which is to say that a lot of us only have interacted with a computer using a Graphics User Interface (Gui's), and that these installation require that you be familiar with Command Line Interfaces (CLI) like a terminal window or a shell.
	</para>
	<para>If you don't know what I am talking about then I recommend you ask someone (me possibly) about what shell windows are, and probably what a UNIX-based Operating system looks like, especially without a GUI.

		<sect3>
			<title>What is it?</title>
			<para>
			The OIO system starts a higher level of abstraction
			- starting with modeling "forms". The forms are then
			used to model/build progress notes etc. The OIO system
			makes use of a relational database back-end (PostgreSQL) - 1) making the data/metadata/presentation separation more distinct, 2) making integration with other system (e.g. legacy systems, GNUMed, SQL Clinic etc) easier, 3) making query construction/extension easier (via SQL).
			</para>
			
			<para>If you search the OpenHealth mailing list archives, you will see extensive discussion regarding this in the context of GEHR and OIO. GEHR uses the same approach but calls this intermediate level of abstraction "archetypes".  The advantage of the OIO/GEHR approach is that the metadata components can be plug-and-play - meaning that the system can be easily extended/customized AND portable medical records become easier to implement.

I ran into this same problem after the end of day light savings time. :-)
The reason for this is that PostgreSQL does not like US/Pacific for time
zone. The fix is to provide the time stamp in GMT time.

The fix is to add the following to the OIO/forms/archive_form/archive_b
method:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
&lt;dtml-if time&gt;
 &lt;dtml-call "REQUEST.set('time_string', _.str(time.toZone('GMT')))"&gt;
&lt;/dtml-if&gt;
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
(it goes right before the following, make sure time=time_string in the
parameter list)
==========================================
&lt;!--#in "putin_archived_forms_c(
                   form=name,
                   archivedname=newname,
                   version=newversion_value,
                   time=time_string,
                   creator=creator,
                   description=description
     )"--&gt;
==========================================
So, basically the new routine converts the time stamp into GMT time - I
think GMT-7  or GMT-8 for US/Pacific, depending on daylight saving time
status.

Best regards,

Andrew

		<title>Where to to get it</title>
		<para>You can get the entire package which include everything you need like Zope products and even python from <ulink url="http://www.freepm.org:8080/freepm_download/fpm_downloads">Here</ulink> and choosing FreePM-1.0b6-FULL-linux2-x86.tar.gz.  This will include all the documentation.

			<title>Basic Installation of FreePM</title>
			<para>Given that Tim Cook has put together everything you need to get a fully running FreePM application, I will first deal with installing the application as if you downloaded the full 14MB gzipped file. However, since Zope can be installed separately, and you  may have other Zope applications going on, I will also discuss how to install the FreePM Zope product separately from installing Zope.
		</para>
    
			<sect4>
				<title>Using the 14MB FreePM download</title>
				<para>Once you have downloaded the 14 MB package, be sure to also download the extensions_for_1.0b6.tar.gz. At this point, it really doesn't matter what directory you have download the gzipped tar files into, but to play it clean and safe, I would download them or move them into their own directory. Then go ahead and <userinput> gunzip FreePM-1.0b6-FULL-linux2-x86.tar.gz </userinput> to unzip the file and then <userinput>tar xvf FreePM-1.0b6-FULL-linux2-x86.tar.gz</userinput>
				</para>
				<para>Once the tar file has finished unpacking, you should see a new directory called FreePM-1.0b6-FULL-linux2-x86.  To make things easier I would change the name of this directory to 'FreePM' like so <userinput>mv FreePM-1.0b6-FULL-linux2-x86 FreePM</userinput>

		    		</para>

			<title>Running the Zope Server</title>
			<para>Tim Cook also wrote two scripts to start the server and stop the server. Be sure you our in the FreePM directory.  You will know this if you see the files 'start' and 'stop' in there.  It is also the same directory where you ran the <userinput>./install</userinput>.  To start the Zope server, type <userinput>./start</userinput>.  However you might want to type <userinput>./start&</userinput> to make it a background process which will free up your terminal window.  This will also allow you to stop the Zope Server by typing <userinput>./stop</userinput> instead of hitting the CRTL-C key combination, a rather blunt way of stopping the Zope server and not an aestheically pleasing way of stopping the zope process.

		    <sect4>
			<title>Installing the FreePM zope products </title>
			<para>The key thing before I talk about installing the zope products is that, the first user, Admin, can only add other users and can not by itself actaully magane any products.  You first need to add a new user and make the user a manager before you can do anything else.
			</para>
			<para>
			To log into the running Zope server, you need to open a browser, type in http://127.0.0.1:8080 or depending on how new the Zope server is http://127.0.0.1:9673.  If you look at the output during the install it will tell you what to what port to connect.  <caution><para>Note: Using the old port 8080 would conflict, which is why Zope changed the port connection.</para></caution> At this point you should the zope introductory page, if not, make sure you have the correct port.

			<para>Go ahead and click on the link that says Zope management interface or enter http:127.0.0.1:8080/manage and you should the zope management screen. You know you are in the correct section if you see a root folder at the top of the Left Frame.

			<para>I am having problems sucessfully loggin out completely using zope, so when you intend to switch users, be sure to completely close all broswer windows.</para>
			<para>Once you added a new user that has the role of manager, log back in.  THat is to say, Close all browers and open up a new browers and go the the zope management screen.  You should be asked for a login at this point.  Go ahead and enter in you new user login and password.</para>
			<para>Once you are logged in as an user (not the admin user), go ahead and click on the Root Folder on the top of the left frame. Scrool to the bottom of the Right Frame and you should see the Import/Export button. You see a new screen. In the Field Import File Name, enter FreePMProduct.zexp and then hit the import button.  You should see a new scree nindicating success</para>
			<para>The next step, is to again hit on the Root Folder Icon at the TOP LEFT FRAME. Again hit the Import/Export button, but this time, you want to import FreePM.zexp. Then hit the Import button. <caution><para>Note that it will take some time to import the FreePM.zexp Zope product as it is quite large and you may get a brower error. I almost lost hair doing this stage because I coulnd tfigure out what was going wrong. In fact nothing was going wrong, it just took some time to import this large (32MB) zope prodcut.

			<para>The other thing I want to point out is that this is not an un-biased LDP, I may stress something more than others because I think the foundation is better or that I have seen it actually work, so if you feel something is not right, please feel free to let me know.

			<title>Debian as Standard linux distribution</title>
				<para>I realize that urging people to consider debian as the standard linux system when it comes to medical applications is probably like arguing about religions. But.. :) The point is that our audience is not Linux gurus who only use slack or can configure applications from source tar balls.  Debian provides an extremely sophisticated and easy to use installation process that is ideal for people who want to get a system running.

		<sect2><title>I work and what is needed.</title>
			
			<para>Now that I have been working for almost two weeks, here are a few things I have learned.  While a resident, I did part of my training at the VA hospitals which had a superb information system, but it required that we type out everything from the smallest order to the emergency stat orders.  This seemed to work weel for teh VA since most of the Doctors had residents do their notes or they tended to dictate very little, writing very breif, sometimes cryptic, notes about the status of their patient.  Now that I am in the private world, the only thing that seems to be saving medicine are the transciptionists who take the garbled spped talk that doctors do and type out coherent statements.  The problem that I see with many of these data systems is that seem to assume that doctors have the time which they dont (there is barely enough time to see a patient properly let alone do all the coding na dthen write out a clear note.</para>
<para>Several idea come out that doctors will merely have to tick off boxes on a palm device to indicate what they did, but this is fine for billing but not so for the actualy medical record, which even though is breif contains much more subtley then any billing coding system could have.  Perhaps what we need is to maintain the medical record in its narrative form and have a parser go throught it and pull the important bits and then it would enter this stuff into database. It is an idea, but surely a worthwhile one since Doctors simply can not sit aroung computer terminals (as I am doing, but it is a Sunday)
