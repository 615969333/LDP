			<revremark>Major changes. Conversion from linuxdoc to DocBook format. Have basically edited out nutrition sections and most of the German section for now until I can get help again the German section. Have switched focus of the article to Medical informatics and applications, less to research applications which should probably be a different article. Will most likely put these things I will not maintain at the end, so someone else has some where to begin.
			Whew. Tired from DocBook Conversion.

		<title>SQL Clinic</title>

		<para>
		<ulink url="http://www.sqlclinic.net"> SQLclinic</ulink> is an impressive application that was developed for mental health workers, sponsored by their local hospital. What is most impressive is the amount of documentation. However it is unclear how useful the application would be for other non mental-health professionals.

		<para>
			<blockquote>
				<attribution>Thomas Good writes</attribution>
					<para>
					To address the point about its utility outside the mental health sector: we are doing a spinoff called (believe it or not) SQL Cafe.  Why?  The local Indian restaurant (www.tasteofindia.org - I do their web pages) has hired us to design a custom database that tracks vendors, customers, uses a cgi based online menu (to replace the html version, so modifications don't require html skills) and so on.
					</para>
					
					<para>
					Seriously,  one other thing about SQL Clinic is that it was designed to be reverse engineered and used for other purposes.  It's all based on Lincoln Stein's CGI.pm module (a terrific tool) and the incredible horsepower of Postgres.  So I suspect, once Ingo and I get it a bit more streamlined, that SQL Clinic may have greater utility as an example of how to access postgres via perl than as a mere clinical application.  At least that is our goal.

					<para> Medical informatics has to do with all aspects of understanding and promoting the effective organization, analysis, management, and use of information in health care. While the field of medical informatics shares the general scope of these interests with some other health care specialties and disciplines, medical informatics has developed its own areas of emphasis and approaches that have set it apart from other disciplines and specialties. For one, a common thread through medical informatics has been the emphasis on technology as an integral tool to help organize, analyze, manage, and use information. In addition, as professionals involved at the intersection of information and technology and health care, those in medical informatics have historically tended to be engaged in the research, development, and evaluation side of things, and in studying and teaching the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of data applications in health care. However, today medical informatics also counts among its profession many whose activities are focussed on dimensions that include the administration and everyday collection and use of information in health care.

<p>What Is Medical Informatics - Some Formal Definitions of the Field
Medical Informatics has been emerging as a discipline in its own right over the past quarter century.  During that evolution, there have been a number of notable attempts along the way to define the field in scientific and formal yet succinct terms, and in many cases each has built on its predecessors.  Following are some of the more often-cited of those definitions.  Allan H. Levy, 1977 - identified the scope of medical informatics as "...dealing with the problems associated with information, its acquisition, analysis, and dissemination in health care delivery processes." (1) Morris F. Collen, 1977 - "Medical informatics is the application of computer technology to all fields of medicine - medical care, medical teaching, and medical research." (2) Jan van Bemmel, 1984 - "Medical informatics comprises the theoretical and practical aspects of information processing and communication, based on knowledge and experience derived from processes in medical and health care." (3) Jack D. Myers, 1986 - "...a developing body of knowledge and set of techniques concerning the organization and management of information in support of medical research, education, and patient care." (4) Donald A.B. Lindberg, 1987 - "Medical informatics attempts to provide the theoretical and scientific basis for the application of computer and automated information systems to biomedicine and health affairs . . . medical informatics studies biomedical information, data, and knowledge - their storage, retrieval, and optimal use for problem-solving and decision-making. (5) M.S. Blois and Edward H. Shortliffe, 1990 - "Medical informatics is the rapidly developing scientific field that deals with the storage, retrieval, and optimal use of biomedical information, data, and knowledge for problem solving and decision making." (6) British Medical Informatics Society - "...the understanding, skills, and tools that enable the sharing and use of information to deliver healthcare and promote health" and "...the name of an academic discipline developed and pursued over the past decades by a world-wide scientific community engaged in advancing and teaching knowledge about the application of information and technologies to healthcare - the place where health, information and computer sciences, psychology, epidemiology, and engineering intersect.

It is based on an article in the May 1989 issue of Bicycling Magazine, pp. 100-103. It provides a good estimate of the number of calories burned based on time, distance, rider weight, wind speed and direction, drafting, and climbing.

<sect1>Java SmokingMeter
<p>
<url url="http://smokingmeter.sourceforge.net/" name="SmokingMeter"> is a stand alone Java application that tells ex-smokers for how long they have quit smoking, how much money they have saved, and how many cigarettes they have avoided.

<sect1>weight
<p>
<url url="http://world.std.com/~damned/software.html" name="weight"> is a GPL program, which helps users keep track of their weight. It computes a moving weighted average based upon daily weight (useful because it smoothes the fluctuation of daily weights), can compute caloric debt, and can plot monthly, quarterly, annual, and other graphs of weight.

<sect> Things to Be Done
<p>
<sect1> Notes
<p>I am going to place things here when I don't know where exactly to put them.


<sect1>Conversion of ECGs - ecg2png
<p>
<url url="http://www.cardiothink.com/downloads/ecg2png/" name="ecg2png"> converts scanned 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) into PNG format and a web-friendly image size. The problems this program solves are that an ECG scanned at relatively high resolution puts a large memory load on the Web browser because it contains about 6 million color pixels. Also, typical scanners convert a clean paper ECG into many colors, not just red, black, and white. The resulting file cannot be
compressed efficiently and takes more time to transmit over low-speed network connections. This program shrinks the image while preserving the signal and cleans up the color map, yielding a bitmap that is well-suited for Web-based distribution of ECG images.

<sect1>REALTIQ - ReAligning Tissue Quantifier
<p>
REALTIQ stands for <it>Re-aligning Tissue Quantification</it>, the software is currently in the alpha-stage.
<p>
Software Features:
<itemize>
<item>Re-align any patient-scan to new arbitrary axes by tri-linear interpolation
<item>Segmentation of long-bone tissue
<item>Quantification of long-bone tissue
<item>DICOM compatible
</itemize>

<p>
Description: A pre-version of this software was developed for use in a study on the relations of the medullary-canal dimensions and the cortical-bone area at patients suffering from arthritic bone-disease.
<p>
The problem with CAT data is, that if the model (in this case the hand/finger) is not properly aligned with the CAT axis, the cut-planes will only display a distorted view of the bone and quantitative measurement will yield high error-rates.
<p>
REALTIQ reads in a set of DICOM images and displays it to the viewer as a frontal, sagittal and transversal view. The user can specify, intuitively by using the mouse, an axis through this data, as well as a bounding-box around that axis. The dataset will be mapped to that new
axis, so that the structures of interest are now properly aligned. In a second step, the software calculates:

<itemize>
<item>Medullary-canal diameters (in several directions)
<item>Medullary-canal area / absorption rate
<item>Cortical-bone diameters (in several directions)
<item>Cortical-bone area / absorption rate
</itemize>

<sect1>CTSim
<p>
<url url="http://www.ctsim.org/" name="CTSim"> is a Computed Tomography simulator under the GPL license. It simulates the process of obtaining x-ray data around a phantom object. It then uses various reconstruction algorithms for reconstructing the original image. The scanning
and reconstruction processes can be animated as a tutorial to computed tomography. Precompiled versions are
available for Microsoft Windows and Linux.


<sect1>XBNC
<p>
<url url="http://www.b3e.jussieu.fr/xnbc/" name="XNBC"> is a software package for simulating biological neural networks. Four neuron models are available, three phenomenologic models (xnbc, leaky integrator and conditional burster) and an ion-conductance based model. Inputs to
the simulated neurons can be provided by experimental data stored in files, allowing the creation of <it>hybrid</it> networks. Graphic tools are used to describe the modeled neurons as well as the network.

<sect1 id="thought">
	<title>My thoughts</title>
	<para>Having spend some time on looking at the available software, I can only say that currently, we simply have an abundance of development, but little progress.  I keep seeing multiple projects trying to achieve the same thing, but the resources are spread too think and so they fail.  I wonder if there were some way to concentrate the various developers onto one project.
	</para>
	
	<para>The other thing I want to point out is that this is not an un-biased LDP, I may stress something more than others because I think the foundation is better or that I have seen it actually work, so if you feel something is not right, please feel free to let me know.
