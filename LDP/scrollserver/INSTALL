Installation of ScrollServer is manual right now, but not too difficult:

1. Create the user scrollserver
2. Place the script files in that user's home directory
3. Create the directory /var/cache/scrollserver
4. Assign ownership of that directory to the scrollserver user
5. Run the scrollserver.py script as the scrollserver user

Note: You really don't *need* a new user -- but the user who runs the
scrollserver script must have full permissions to /var/cache/scrollserver.
And it's never a good idea to run a program with more permissions than
necessary.
