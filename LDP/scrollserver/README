Introduction
------------

This is ScrollServer, a Python based http server that provides access to
a scrollkeeper database with any web browser.

ScrollServer is in very early development, but it is already useful. It has
been tested on RedHat 7.1 and Debian Woody. Reports of success or failure on
other systems greatly appreciated.

Known Bugs
----------

Images are not displayed for sources files not in html format.

XML files are not yet supported.

Gnome specific uris such as gnome-help:foo don't work. I and the gnome-doc
people are working on a solution.

KDE documents haven't even been looked at yet.

HTML is cached, but there is no cache management.
