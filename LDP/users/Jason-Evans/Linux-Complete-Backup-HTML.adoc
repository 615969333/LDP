Imagine your disk drive has just become a very expensive hockey puck.
Imagine you have had a fire, and your computer case now looks like
something Salvador Dalĩ would like to paint. Now what?

Total restore, sometimes called bare metal recovery, is the process of
rebuilding a computer after a catastrophic failure. In order to make a
total restoration, you must have complete backups, not only of your file
system, but of partition information and other data. This HOWTO is a
step-by-step tutorial on how to back up a Linux computer so as to be
able to make a bare metal recovery, and how to make that bare metal
recovery. It includes some related scripts.
