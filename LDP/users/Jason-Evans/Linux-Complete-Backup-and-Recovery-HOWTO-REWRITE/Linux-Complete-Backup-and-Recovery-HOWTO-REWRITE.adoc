== Introduction

Losing data is no laughing matter. Disks fails, servers crash, and sometimes mistakes happen. How do we avoid catastrophic losses of data? We make backups! This guide is an attempt to show the Linux newbie how to back up a simple web server, but it's not limited to that. Using the techniques in this quide, you can back up your Linux desktop to a NAS or just your family photos to Dropbox. This guide is meant to be more than just a dry howto for a specific type of server. Linux is flexible and easy to adapt to a number of uses. Where you learn one skill, you can apply it to a thousand other issues.

== Overview

== Preparation

You will need a computer or server running CentOS or Ubuntu in a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) configuration. You may apply the strategies discussed to many other distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, Debian, or one of their derivatives. This guide touches on physical servers and VM's (virtual machines).

Note: 
Do your normal backups on their regular schedule. This HOWTO is useless if you don't do that.

=== What do I need to back up?

There are three directories that absolutely must be backed up: `/home`, `/var/www`, and `/etc` as well as the MySQL database.
